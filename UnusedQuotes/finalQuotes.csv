"Never thrown a party? What about that big bash we had with all the champagne and musicians and holy men and everything?"
"Bart didn't get one vote?! Oh, this is the worst thing that ever happened to us. Alright, allright, spilled milk, spilled milk, spilled milk. What are you so mopey about?"
"Oh."
"And?"
"Hey, just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand."
"Me?"
"I don't think you realize what you're saying."
"Did you hear that, Marge? She called me a baboon! The stupidest, ugliest, smelliest ape of them all!"
"Go Away."
"Lisa, don't hold anything back. You can tell me. Are you crying because you called Daddy a baboon?"
"Nuts."
"This isn't going well at all."
"No, no, no. I just wish I knew what to say."
"Although, maybe this will help. Now you lost someone special and it hurts. I'm lucky because I never lost anyone special to me. Everyone special to me is under this roof."
"Oh."
"It's true. Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life, Lisa. There's probably some place where they all get together, and the food is real good, and guys like me are serving drinks. Oh well, maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your doll house for you. At least, I'm good at monkey work. You know... monkey. You know what I mean?"
"I can hold these nails in place with my tail."
"Gimme a banana."
"Come on, you're holding out on me."
"Think nothing of it."
"Hey, what's the matter, son?"
"Hey son, would you have gotten any money for being class president?"
"Would you have to do extra work?"
"And is this Martin guy going to get to do anything neat, like throw out the first ball at the world series, huh?"
"So, let the baby have his bottle, huh? That's my motto."
"Holy-moly... talk about parenting!"
"Uh oh."
"Sleep well, Maggie. Ah, three for three."
"Up... up... up... up... up... up. Don't say anything, Marge. Let's just go to bed. I'm on the biggest roll of my life."
"Mmm... hors doovers."
"I promised I wouldn't eat? Never! You lie!"
"Oh son, when you're older, you'll know better."
"Hmmm. Oh, baby! Mmmm. Yeah."
"How do I look?"
"Do we have enough gag ice cubs?"
"What are all our friends names again?"
"Why not? I paid for it."
"Hey, Flanders, next time why don't you put a little alcohol in it?"
"Really? Well I do have a warm sense of well-being and I seem to be ssslurring my shpeech... you're right! Give me another."
"No."
"Oh, Dr. Hibbert. Enjoying the party?"
"It was me! You fell for it!"
"You should see the look on your face. It's priceless."
"Bart! Come over here."
"You little monkey... you're a little monkey, aren't you?"
"Bart, do that thing you do that's so cute."
"That thing you know how to do."
"Go to bed."
"Hey, everybody! Look, I'm the funniest guy in the world!"
"I've been wantin' to tell you off for years, but I've never had the nerve."
"You stink! You and your whole lousy operation stinks! I quit!"
"All right then."
"Could you... give me a handful of peanuts... Maude?"
"Not those peanuts. The ones at the bottom."
"Why? What'd you do?"
"Marge!"
"Where-where are we going?"
"The way I acted?"
"So I said: I must get out of these wet clothes and into a dry martini."
"I put it there."
"I slipped it into your glass as a gag."
"I'm sorry, honey. Can't we just forget it and go to church."
"No, I didn't... I... Oh, you mean inside, don't you?"
"About last night... you might have noticed Daddy acting a little strange and you probably don't understand why."
"I admit it. I didn't know when to say when. I'm sorry it happened and I just hope you didn't lose a lot of respect for me."
"Aw."
"Marge, Marge."
"Sorry, Reverend."
"Hmmmm."
"Oh, well, it's very tempting. Really a wonderful idea."
"Marge! What are you doing? Are you insane?!"
"Marriage encounter weekend, here I come!"
"They're holding it at Catfish Lake. They couldn't call it Catfish Lake if it didn't have a catfish in it."
"Oh dear. If we can't find a babysitter, we can't go. What a kick in the teeth."
"No, you don't!"
"Marge, just puttin' a few last things in the trunk."
"Hmmm, bait."
"Whoa, better get some gas."
"Fill 'er up. I guess I'll go and stretch my legs."
"Catfish Lake."
"Wait, wait a minute... wait a minute. Who's General Sherman?"
"Oh yeah."
"Whoa, who says that?"
"Oh."
"Hmmmm. Gentlemen: I am going to catch General Sherman!"
"None of your business, Flanders."
"Uh say... uh... Reverend... are we gonna get a chance to do any fishing?"
"Oh."
"I see. I also understand bowling expressions."
"Lucky you don't keep guns in the house."
"Ohhh, because I got drunk and looked down her dress."
"She's perfect."
"Well, sometimes that can be annoying."
"I'm done."
"It's true. It's all true."
"Sorry."
"I only did that a couple of times."
"Out at five, catch General Sherman at five-thirty, clean him at six, eat him at six-thirty, back in bed by seven with no incriminating evidence. . The perfect crime."
"Would this be a good time to be honest?"
"You're right, I am. Help me, Marge. What do I do to be a good guy?"
"No."
"All right. But I can't sleep. Can I take a walk?"
"Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband... Gotta be a good husband."
"Hey, kid! You forgot your... WHOA!"
"Go ahead, General Sherman! Waste your strength, you big ugly catfish. I gotta skillet and a stick of butter with your name on it."
"Good! Give up!"
"Huh?"
"Okay, fish, you're probably wondering why I'm still here. Catching you will make me the most famous fisherman there is, right up there with... that... the a... bald guy on that cable fishing show."
"Whoa! Holy mackerel!"
"I love you, but I must kill you."
"I AM THE CHAMPIONS / I AM THE CHAMPIONS / NO TIME FOR LOSERS / CAUSE I AM THE CHAMPIONS / OF THE WORLLLLD!"
"Uh, oh."
"Hi, honey. Uh, oh. How's the marriage retreat going?"
"Marge, you don't know what this fish means. This fish represents a better life for both of us. This fish makes me a champion and a hero."
"To those weirdos in the worm store."
"Well, if that's the way you feel... I'll throw it back."
"Watch."
"Wow, I did it! I gave up fame and breakfast for my marriage. I fought it for six hours. She says one word and I toss it back. And you're telling me our marriage is in trouble? Come here, baby."
"We're back!"
"Same as usual. Perfectomundo."
"I never knew what Superman saw in her. Give me Wonder Woman! And that golden lariat. She can tie me up any time."
"I was just kidding, Marge. Hey, what does everyone say to dinner at Krusty Burger? My treat!"
"All right, what are you getting at?"
"A hundred bucks?! For a comic book? Who drew it, Micha-ma-langelo?"
"Well, t.s."
"No."
"No."
"No."
"No."
"No."
"No."
"No."
"No! Now, look, son, we all know that usually when you bug me like this, I give in, so I'm not mad at you for trying. It shows you've been paying attention. But we all know I'm not gonna give you a hundred dollars. Now are you gonna stop bugging me?"
"Are you?"
"Are you?"
"Are you?"
"Are you?"
"Are you?"
"Are you?"
"Are you?"
"Are you?"
"Are you?"
"Are you?"
"Hee hee, I win! In your face! Yeah! How do you like them apples? Woo hoo hoo!"
"Bart! What are you staring at?"
"Bart! Stop it!"
"Hey, what's all the --"
"My beer... my beer... my beautiful beer."
"What's the problem, boy?"
"Hey, when I was your age, fifty cents was a lot of money."
"Nah."
"Son, I'm proud of you. I was twice your age before I figured that out."
"They're fine."
"Joke's on them. If the core explodes, there won't be any power to light that sign."
"How many hairs on my head? Without looking!"
"I can't believe you guys. There's a human being out there with millions of dollars who needs our help. And you don't wanna cash in? That's why you losers are stuck in this crummy, dead end job."
"Sorry, sir."
"Marge! Marge! What's my blood type?"
"Aw, nuts! Extremely rare blood and I don't have it."
"Earmuffs."
"Aw, old man Burns is gonna kick off if he doesn't get some Double-O-Negative blood, but nobody at the plant has it."
"Woo! Yes! All right! Woo! Congratulations, boy! You've got a date with a needle!"
"Yeah, you have the right to remain silent."
"Bart, it's not like I'm asking you to give blood for free. That would be crazy! You're a little young to understand this, but when you save a rich man's life, he showers you with riches. Don't you know the story of Hercules and the Lion?"
"Yeah, probably. Anyway, once upon a time there was a big mean lion who got a thorn in his paw. And all the village people tried to pull it out, but nobody was strong enough. So they got Hercules, and Hercules used his mighty strength, and bingo. Anyway, the moral is, the lion was so happy, he gave Hercules this big thing of riches."
"It was the olden days!"
"Hey, let's go! Emergency! Life-or-death here!"
"Now let's get the show on the road."
"Eh.... the boy."
"Mr. Burns... he's okay! Jackpot!"
"Bill... Bill... Summons... Bill... Wait a minute. From C.M. Burns? Is this it? Yes, this is it! Woo-hoo! Woo!"
"Marge! Lisa! Maggie! Let's do this out in the yard where the neighbors can see!"
"Lisa, dim the lights! No, turn on more lights! But do something!"
"It's a little thin, but that's okay, could be a check."
"""Better half,"" Marge. ""Better half."""
"All right, there's no check, just a card. But don't panic. I'm sure it tells us what we're getting and where we can pick it up. ""Dear Bart... Thank you kindly for the blood. Yours truly, Montgomery Burns."" It's just a card!"
"This is some way to show your gratitude. No gold. No diamonds. No rubies. Not even a lousy card. Wait a minute, there was a card. That's what got me so mad in the first place."
"Marge, you're my wife and I love you very much. But you're living in a world of make-believe. With flowers and bells and leprechauns, and magic frogs with funny little hats..."
"Bart!"
"I promised my boy one simple thing: Lots of riches. And that man broke my promise. Well, I've had it! Bart, take a letter."
"""Dear Mr. Burns. I'm so glaaad you enjoyed my son's blood. And your caard was just great. In case you can't tell, I'm being sarcastic. You stink!"" Could you read that last part back to me?"
"Good. ""You are a senile, buck-toothed old mummy with bony girl arms... and you smell like..."""
"An elephant's butt."
"Yup!"
"Forget it, Marge!"
"Oh, all right. You always do that hand thing! And it usually works."
"Cheap son-of-a..."
"Hmmm..."
"Oh, Marge, you saved me from making a big mistake. Y'know, I finally understand the meaning of mmphm hnmph."
"Where's the letter?"
"Where is it?"
"Well, it's somewhere! It didn't just get up and walk away!"
"Bart, have you seen the letter?"
"All right, think very carefully. Where did you see it last?"
"Uh huh."
"Yeah..."
"Why did you do that?"
"I'll show you mad in the morning."
"She's right. Okay, think, Homer. Don't panic. They don't pick up the mail till noon. There's still time!"
"Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow."
"Locked, eh? Well, I just might have a little surprise up my sleeve for old Mr. Lock. Step aside, boy."
"What does it look like? I'll get our letter so wet, the ink will run and no one will be able to read it."
"So a few people won't get a few letters. Boo-hoo. You know the kinda letters people write: ""Dear Somebody-You-Never-Heard-Of... How is So-and-So? Blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. Yours truly, Some Bozo."" Big loss."
"Now Bart, you keep an eye out for the mailman. Just give me some kind of signal."
"That's a good one. We'll use that."
"Uh, uh I-I guess it wouldn't do any good to run, 'cause you're our mail lady and you know my name and address and everything, huh?"
"Well, I'm still gonna run!"
"Hello, my name is Mr. Burns. I believe you have a letter for me."
"I don't know."
"Great plan, Bart."
"Lisa, I don't know what you're doing, but it's very strange and your father is trying to worry."
"Oops."
"Twenty eight minutes till Burns comes. Time for operation Mail Take."
"Homer Simpson."
"Yeah, well I'll be on my --"
"Hey, c'mon, Joey! Do you have to twist my arm?"
"Oh, I've never seen Mr. Burns this mad and he's always kinda mad."
"Me and my big... letter writing pen!"
"Okay, here's the plan. You can move in with your sisters and raise the kids. And I'll... die in a gutter. It's practical and within our means."
"I got my problems, Moe. Give me another one."
"Oh, woe is me."
"Mr. Burns, you brought us a present."
"What did I tell you? I'll bet it's filled with diamonds, rubies, sapphires, pearls..."
"Marge, what does it do?"
"Marge! Really, what does it do?"
"Save a guy's life, and whattaya get? Nothin'! Worse than nothin'! Just a big, scary rock."
"Wait a minute. If I hadn't written that nasty letter, we wouldn't have gotten anything!"
"Exactly. It's just a bunch of stuff that happened."
"Amen to that!"
"Who stole my shirt? Who stole my shirt?"
"Oh thank you, Marge -- Pink?"
"Marge, I can't wear a pink shirt to work. Everybody wears white shirts. I'm not popular enough to be different."
"Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme!"
"Oh no... Pink. Pink! PINK! It's all over, Marge. It's all over."
"You! You did this to me!"
"Mmm, thanks -- It looks... Hey, wait a minute! Just because I'm wearing a pink shirt, it doesn't mean I'm some kind of a... pink doughnut-eater! Although it is tempting --"
"You don't understand... my son just threw his red hat in with the white laundry..."
"Print name?"
"Honey, do me a favor. Fill out this form."
"All right, all right. I'll get Lisa to do it."
"Lisa, you like homework. Could you fill out this form for me?"
"O-kay."
"No deal."
"Son, it's no different than the time I let you vote for me. Remember that absentee ballot?"
"Look at him!"
"Awww."
"Dog on Fire! Dog on Fire!"
"Yes, I'm hearing one right now, while I'm trying to watch TV."
"Bart! Shut up or I'll shut you up!"
"So, did I pass?"
"The devil with his fly open."
"That's a spill on a floor with bugs goin' after it. They're gonna eat it."
"Arrghh!"
"The boy! This isn't fair! How can you tell who's sane and who's insane?"
"Who are you?"
"I'm Homer Simpson, from the Simpsons."
"Oh, of course I've heard of you. I mean you'd have to be living under a rock not to know -- what'd you say your name was?"
"Doesn't ring a bell."
"What was that last one?"
"Nope."
"Wow. How do you do that thing with your feet?"
"No, that thing with your feet."
"Because I wore a pink shirt."
"What'd you wear?"
"Bbl--bbl--bbl--bbl--"
"Hey, Michael, I don't get it. These guys seem as normal as you and me."
"Okay. Five times nine."
"Wowww."
"Hey, Chief."
"Gee, I gotta call my family."
"Oh, this is so embarrassing, calling 'em from a nut house. I mean, they think I'm a god."
"Oh great! And uh, try to put a good face on this. Tell them this is one of those places where rich women lose weight."
"That's all right, son."
"What's that?"
"This place is so strange. Mike, I'm ashamed to admit it to another guy, but I'm... scared."
"Pancakes... football... Boobies..."
"Was the door locked?"
"Was it raining?"
"Were you out of gas?"
"Baby."
"Mmm... pancakes."
"Marge!"
"That's the most flattering thing anyone has ever said to me. Could I have it in writing, please?"
"Not insane."
"Thanks a lot, Michael. You really helped me get through this. If you ever find your marbles, come visit us."
"You are? Why?"
"Boy, when I get home, I'm going to wrap my hands around your neck --"
"-- And smother you with kisses."
"Now listen. I'm bringing Michael Jackson home to stay with us for a few days... Isn't that cute -- he's heard of you! Now, make sure we have plenty of cold cuts, and put some beer on ice."
"Are you sure you're here voluntarily?"
"Thanks everybody! It's great to be sane."
"Here he is! Here's the guy you wanna see."
"Huh? Huh?"
"Come off. I'm sane now."
"Not me. I got this."
"Stupid junk mail... ""You May Have Already Won!"" Yeah, win this... ""Here's Good News for Homer Simpsoy""... I'll see that he gets it. How dumb do they think I am?"
"Huh? A check?"
"One Million dollars? I'm rich!"
"Oh yeah? Well, what makes you so damn sure?"
"Shut up."
"I had a feeling it was too good to be true. Every time you get a million dollars something queers the deal."
"Marge, I never read a magazine in my life and I'm not gonna start now."
"Hey, a cartoon."
"""Well dear, you always wanted a compact."" -- Ain't it the truth."
"Oh, Marge. Cartoons don't have any deep meaning. They're just stupid drawings that give you a cheap laugh."
"Nah, you go ahead."
"As Tolstoy said in ""Quotable Notables,"" ""Give me learning, sir, and you may keep your black bread."""
"Marge, look at them staring at that idiot box. God forbid they would ever read something and improve their minds."
"Ooh... How about the ""V""?"
"It's not just one magazine, Marge. They take hundreds of magazines, filter out the crap, and leave you with something that fits right in your front pocket."
"Those kids don't know what they're missing."
"We're all gonna sit down as a family and listen to an inspiring story of wilderness survival."
"""Then I heard the sound that all Arctic explorers dread: The pitiless bark of the sea lion."" He'll be killed!"
"Don't be so..."
"Oh, you're right."
"Hmph?"
"That reminds me! ""Seven Ways To Spice Up Your Marriage."""
"Marge, you have a nice body. And if you'd like to see me in a costume, you have only to ask."
"Where do you think? This baby never steers you wrong. And it was free. Free!"
"Wow! ""Win a Trip to Washington D.C.""! ""All expenses paid... VIP tour""... Oh. It's for kids."
"Ooh... And Miss? Just one more question --"
"Sweetheart, there's nothing I wouldn't do for that magazine."
"YEAH! Damn right!"
"Uh-uh."
"Woo hoo! Who would've guessed reading and writing would pay off?"
"Playing cards, notepad, aspirin, sewing kit, pilot's wing pin, propellor-shaped swizzle stick, sleeping mask and anything else I've got coming to me."
"We're all gonna die!"
"Look, Marge, that guy has the same last name we do... Taxi!"
"BOOOOO!"
"Wowww -- A shoehorn! Just like in the movies!"
"Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off. Shoe goes on, shoe goes off."
"Stupid welcoming mint! Y'ello."
"Wake-up call? It's two AM!"
"Free food?!"
"Ooh! I love your magazine. My favorite section is ""How To Increase Your Word Power."" That thing is really, really, really good."
"Miss? What does the ""I"" stand for?"
"Ah! What does the ""I"" stand for again?"
"Yeah, right."
"Mmmmmm... Money."
"Lousy cheap country..."
"BART! Get out of the Spirit of St. Louis!"
"Hey, what's so funny?"
"Oh Marge, grow up."
"Who's that?"
"Bart, are you ready to go to... I'll room service you..."
"Yeah, your other speech was a little more crowd pleasin'."
"Gimme one of those!"
"Give her the check!"
"I was serious."
"I'm almost done."
"I'll be there. Not-y not-y not."
"Well, why doesn't he just say so?"
"Oh, here we go again. Look, I don't care if Ned Flanders is the nicest guy in the world, he's a jerk. End of story."
"Excuse me? Better? Thanks a lot, Marge, you really put me in my place."
"Don't get me wrong, it's worth feeling three inches tall to find out what kind of a person you really are. Marge Simpson... President of the International We Love Flanders Fan Club..."
"Stupid Flanders... always showing off. Go ahead, Marge, have a ball... What if they game back and I was dead from not eating? They'd cry their eyes out. We should have never gone to the Flanders'. Oh, why did we go to the Flanders' house and leave Homer all alone with no food. And I'd be laughing. Laughing from my grave."
"What is it, boy? What? Mmmmmmmm... bar-b-que."
"Hey, everyone, I'm back! Great to see ya! Nice seein' ya!"
"Hey, no tagbacks."
"The fly was funny and a booger was the icing on the cake..."
"That was a joke?"
"Uh... Sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me."
"Fun? Where is this store, Flanders? The merry old land of Oz?"
"Nah."
"No, it isn't."
"Hmm, let's see."
"Nah."
"Hmmm."
"Heyyyy."
"Keep your pants on, Flanders! I'm wishing as fast as I can!"
"Ooooh."
"Mmmm -- too far."
"Okay. Ready."
"Yesssss! Oh yessss! Read it and weep. In your face. I've got more chicken bone!"
"Oooh. That would be a shame."
"Wouldn't it, Flanders?"
"Marge, TV gives so much and asks so little. It's a boy's best friend."
"See, Marge? You knock TV and then it helps you out. I think you owe somebody a little apology."
"Well, if it isn't the Leftorium."
"Ow. Ow. Ow. Ow."
"Hey Flanders, how's business?"
"So, Flanders, have you sold anything?"
"I'm telling you, Flanders' store was dee-serted. So what do you think of your bestest buddy now, Marge?"
"No, I do not know what Schadenfreude is. Please tell me, because I'm dying to know."
"Oh, come on, Lisa. I'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt. He's usually all happy and comfortable and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel... What's the opposite of that shameful joy thing of yours?"
"Boy, those Germans have a word for everything."
"Yeah, come on boy, this better be worth my ten bucks."
"Ooh, the touch of death."
"Hey, boy. How was class?"
"Oh, that'll learn 'im."
"Hey Flanders, when are your busy hours?"
"Lousy. He just sits there all day. He'd have a great job if he didn't own the place."
"Uh, well actually, Moe..."
"Apple, apple, apple... Come on candy bar. Hey, I know you! You're that first apple I didn't want. That sinks it. I'm really gonna let 'em have it this time!"
"Homer Simpson, sir."
"Can I leave, Mr. Burns?"
"But the note was asking you to --"
"Um, Mr. Burns..."
"Sorry, Flanders."
"Huh?"
"Hey, Flanders. Is everything okay?"
"Oh, I get it. It's not good enough for you, but it's good enough for me! Well, I wouldn't be caught dead buying this... Hello!"
"I'll give you twenty bucks for it."
"You were swindled, my friend. Twenty bucks. Take it or leave it."
"Sorry! No cash for Neddie! Homer keep all money! Bye bye Neddie! Bye bye!"
"Twenty dollars?"
"Now I don't want it."
"I changed my mind. It was a passing fancy. Although perhaps if you threw in a few lawn chairs, maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest."
"Hey, Bartle- eeboobely, care for a steak-a-rooney?"
"Daddly-doodly."
"Only seventy-five beans!"
"Oh, I know I need to pay them. But there's just so many."
"I know, but... Wait a minute. I'm Homer Simpson. Ned Flanders lives over there."
"Flanders is in debt? Are you sure?"
"Uh, there's a store where..."
"Yeah."
"Knock 'em dead, boy! Kid's gonna be a black belt in no time."
"Oh, Flanders, I, uh, want to give you your stuff back."
"You're gonna live in your car?"
"I know!"
"Why not?"
"Oh."
"Oh, it's all my fault."
"Yes it is."
"No, I was a swine."
"Listen, Flanders, do you still have that store?"
"Flanders, you open that store tomorrow!"
"I SAID DO IT!"
"Hello, Jerry? Homer Simpson. Remember last month, when I paid back that loan? Well, now I need you to do a favor for me."
"C'mon, you lefties. What'd I tell you?"
"It's all here, and it's all backwards. That's right."
"To Ned Flanders... the richest left- handed man in town."
"Hey, look what I got. A genuine official police badge... Calling all cars... come out with your hands up!"
"That's Officer Homer. Heh heh, heh, heh."
"How much does it pay?"
"Pfft. I make more than that."
"... Bart! Have you started smoking?"
"Don't lie to me boy."
"Aha! Cigarettes, just as I thought."
"Yeah, right. Son... I'm gonna teach you a lesson. I'm going to stand here and watch you smoke every one of those cigarettes. Then maybe you'll learn..."
"Son, I'll never doubt you again."
"A job's a job. I mean, take me. If my plant pollutes the water and poisons the town, by your logic that would make me a criminal."
"See? It was all your imagination."
"Oh, all right."
"Hee hee, hee-hee-hee! Read 'em and weep boys, another pair of sixes."
"You know if you need a hat check girl, I've got a daughter."
"Marge, the only thing going on down there was a lot of male bonding."
"Kill my boy! Kill my boy!"
"Wait till I get you home, boy."
"Well, not the leader... I mean... Oh, it's true, it's true! All the pieces fit."
"I thought he was dead."
"Eww, lemon... ugh, cherry... hmm, custard... mmm, purple."
"Hey, when do we get the check for this?"
"You know who the real crooks are? Those sleazy Hollywood Producers."
"Here's good news. According to this eye-catching article, SAT scores are declining at a slower rate."
"Hey, this is the only paper in America that's not afraid to tell the truth: that everything is just fine."
"What a movie. And that blonde cutie. Does she have assets."
"Huh? Noise. Bad noise!"
"Critical wha...? Okay, okay, don't panic. Whosever problem this is, I'm sure they know how to handle it."
"Huh? AHHH!! It's my problem! We're doomed!!!"
"Gotta think! Gotta think! Okay, somewhere there's a thingee that tells you how to work this stuff. The um... the, uh... the manual! The manual! RIGHT."
"Uh-huh. It's as fat as a phone book! ""Congratulations on your purchase of a Fissionator 1952 Slow Fission Reactor. Get to the point, man! Ooh, what's this?"
"Who'd have thought a nuclear reactor would be so complicated!"
"I don't understand anything! When they look up stupid in the dictionary, there'll be a picture of me!"
"Shut up!"
"Simpson, it's all up to you. It's showtime!"
"Okay, okay, think back to your training..."
"Yes."
"Ooh, a side."
"What?"
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, push the button, got it."
"This is all your fault! Okay, gotta pick a button. Pick a button. Pick a button. Uh, one potato, two potato, three potato, four... No, wait! Bubble gum, bubble gum, in a dish, how many pieces do you wish? No, no!"
"Eenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe, if he hollers let him go... Eenie meenie minee... Moe."
"Hey, you know boys, a nuclear reactor's a lot like a woman. You just have to read the manual and press the right button."
"Magic Johnson! Y'ello."
"Yeah."
"Well, thank you."
"Uh, Magic. What if people think a guy's a hero but he was really just lucky?"
"Thanks, Magic."
"Look, I get enough admiration and respect at work. I don't need it here at home."
"It tastes so bitter. It's like ashes in my mouth!"
"What's your problem, boy?"
"That four-eyes with the big nose? You don't need friends like that."
"What? What is it? What are you doing?"
"Well, as long as it's quiet."
"Oooh, right next to the boss. Eh, he'll never know who did it."
"Huh? Wha?..."
"Their Eanae-eharatou-nah-dule-what?"
"But I really can't tell them anything, sir."
"What am I gonna do? What am I gonna do?"
"Did it work?"
"Uh... ladies and... gentlemen..."
"Um, Grace under pressure is no..."
"Whew! Saved by the bell."
"All right."
"Eeenie meenie minee moe, catch a tiger by the toe... If he hollers let him go, eenie meenie minee moe."
"Sure. Moe."
"You think it's him?"
"What are you talking about? Of course he does."
"We could have seen a monkey."
"He's talking funny talk."
"A Jewish entertainer? Get outta here."
"Mel Brooks is Jewish?"
"Hey Krusty, are you gonna finish that meatloaf or what?"
"Yeah, Krusty, tell us."
"Boy, you don't have to follow in my footsteps."
"Why you little..."
"No, that's it. You've seen everything."
"Gladly."
"Hey, if you don't like it, go to Russia."
"Hey, aren't you a little old for this? You're not even wearing costumes."
"Here you go, kids. Lousy punks..."
"Get a good haul this year?"
"I am very, very proud of you kids."
"I'd like to see that."
"What a dump. Why would Princess Grace live in a place like this?"
"Eeuhgh. What is this thing?"
"Oh yeah? How much?"
"C'mom pal, I don't wanna hear your life story. Paw me!"
"Why at that little shop, right over... there."
"Oh no, wait, it was over there."
"Don't shoot, Don't shoot. They're souvenirs."
"Okay."
"Forget it, you two. As the pants- wearer of this house, I get the first wish."
"Marge, don't flake out on me. That monkey's paw is gonna make our dreams come true."
"Ooh, a luxury car. Good baby. Good Maggie."
"Now you're talkin'!"
"Woo hoo!"
"C'mon, everybody. We're going to the fanciest restaurant in town!"
"Come to think of it, the guy that sold me this thing did say the wishes would bring grave misfortune. I thought he was just being colorful."
"Lisa, that was very selfish of you."
"Ok, Ok. I'll make a wish that can't backfire. I wish for a turkey sandwich, on rye bread, with lettuce and mustard, And...AND! I don't want any zombie turkeys, I don't want to turn into a turkey myself, and I don't want any other weird surprises. You got it?"
"Hey... Hmm. Not bad. Nice hot mustard... good bread... Turkey's a little dry. The turkey's a little dry?! Oh foul, accursed thing! What demon from the depths of hell created thee?!"
"Yeah, but I gotta warn you that this thing is ee ... Yeah, that's what it is. Wanna try it? Heh, heh, heh."
"I wish I had a Monkey's Paw."
"Hiya Bart!!! How's my boy! Heh heh. Heh heh."
"It's good that you made that awful thing, Bart. It's real good."
"He gets it from your side of the family, you know. No monsters on my side."
"Come on... make it... make it... make it... please... please... please."
"Shut up boy. If they make this field goal I win fifty bucks."
"Slowly... slowly... don't make a sound... don't even think, because he can hear your thoughts... then, when he's least expecting it, bash his head in with a chair. End of monster. Heh heh heh."
"I'm not nodding. It's the air conditioning."
"Ouch!"
"Good night, son."
"Well, if you wanted to, you could give me my body back."
"Oh, ah, thanks boy."
"I love you, son."
"You both toilet-trained?"
"Well, okay then... ... Four o'clock... Coupla hours I have to get up and go to work... gotta go to work... go to work."
"Huh? What?"
"For what?"
"How do you know I was sleeping?"
"Camera?"
"How hard can it be?"
"Ooo, what job is that?"
"Sheesh. What a slave driver."
"No. Bart bit me."
"I gotta go shake the dew off the lilly."
"I didn't wake up. It's all a dream. It's just a dream!"
"Umm. Spaghetti."
"Oh, I hate having two heads."
"Y'ello."
"Don't worry, I know it's tonight."
"Uh... isn't this the kind of thing your mother's better at?"
"Wow! And after them, out of all the people in the world, you chose me. Uh huh, yeah, number four and a half reed."
"Whew! Just in the nick of... mmm, beer?"
"Hurry, Moe, hurry! I've only got five minutes till the music store closes."
"Hey, do I tell you how to do your job?"
"You know, if you tip the glass, there won't be so much foam on top."
"Ah. Finished with fifteen seconds to spare."
"The moron next door closed early!"
"Oh, me and my trenchant mouth."
"Hmm. ""Lisa stop playing that stupid... saxophone!"" Yes! That's it!"
"Please, you've got to open that store."
"Okay, okay. But I want you to see a picture of the little girl you're disappointing. Well I don't have one."
"I'll have you know, I wrote it down."
"Number Four and a half -- Stupid gum!"
"Number Four and a Half reed! Whoo hoo!"
"I dunno."
"No."
"No."
"No!... Wait a minute. What was that last one again?"
"Whew, I'd hate to be that kid's father."
"Uh-oh."
"Yeah! Woo! Woo! Yeah!"
"I ordered it for my little girl. Heh... heh."
"That cost eighty-eight dollars!"
"Look, I let you down and I apologize. I know that doesn't make it right, but I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me."
"You didn't mean that!"
"No wonder she hates me. I never even noticed that she was alive."
"Okay."
"Maybe I should just cut my losses, give up on Lisa, and make a fresh start with Maggie."
"Marge, if I spend any more time doing these girl things, I'm gonna -- you know -- go fruity. No, you were right the first time with that quick fix idea. Let's see, quick fix, quick fix. Ah, I'll buy her that pony she's always bugging me for."
"Marge, with today's gasoline prices, we can't afford not to buy a pony."
"Marge, I've got to get her a pony. When I look in Lisa's eyes, I don't see love anymore."
"See, even when you yell at me, I can see love in your eyes."
"Ha ha, you love me."
"Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"Mm."
"Buh."
"Sneh."
"Excuse me, do you sell ponies?"
"""Scot-tish deer-hound."" Hey, this is a dog!"
"Now lady, I'm buying this pony for my little girl, and I don't care what it costs."
"Half a million dollars?!"
"Wow!"
"I'll take it!"
"Uh, sure... let me write you a check."
"Is there a problem with that?"
"Isn't there like a pound where you can pick up cheap ponies that ran away from home?"
"I-I'd like to borrow five thousand dollars."
"Mr. Burns, you do this personally?"
"U-su-ry?"
"I want to buy a pony."
"No. I need to get it for my little girl because she doesn't love me any more."
"Sorry."
"Of course."
"Simpson, you've done it again."
"Sounds like someone's angling for a pony of her own."
"Because she stopped loving me."
"I know you love me. So you don't get squat. Hee hee hee hee."
"I've got it all figured out. By day it will roam free around the neighborhood. And at night it will nestle snugly between the cars in our garage."
"That's for the courts to decide. Marge, she loves me."
"Stable? That sounds expensive."
"This is what love costs a month?"
"Oh nuts."
"I was hoping it'd be money."
"Well you know, we're always buying Maggie vaccinations for diseases she doesn't even have."
"Nah, we're not gonna be doing that."
"First you didn't want me to get the pony. Now, you want me to take it back. Make up your mind."
"Marge, Lisa loves me, the pony stays."
"Fine, I will. There's plenty of money out there for a guy who's willing to work for it."
"Do you have any jewelry you don't need anymore?"
"Need money. Need money."
"One Scratch-for-Cash, please."
"Liberty Bell... Two Liberty Bells... come on, come on, come on... Oh. Yes! Whoo-hoo! Three Liberty Bells! That'll be TEN thousand dollars, Apu."
"Thank you."
"There it is."
"No."
"No! No!"
"No! You can't see... come on!"
"No!"
"Let go. You're ripping it."
"Ohh... I need money."
"You're looking for help?"
"I'm your man!"
"Woo-hoo!"
"...Badge of honor."
"But I eat... Oh."
"Heh heh, the perfect crime."
"Marge, could we go in the other room? I did something last night I'm not proud of and I don't want the kids to hear it."
"I'll work form midnight to eight, come home, sleep for five minutes, eat breakfast, sleep six more minutes, shower, then I have ten minutes to spend as I please. Then I'm off to the power plant, fresh as a daisy."
"Mmm... salty."
"No sir."
"Yes sir."
"I don't know. How long do horses live?"
"Mustn't sleep. Must monitor core."
"Y'ello."
"Thanks. When is she gonna stop loving me?"
"Going for... eight hour walk."
"Homer sleep now."
"Coming right up, sir."
"Yes, sir."
"Yes I do. You see Lisa, grownups have a thing called money..."
"You did?"
"Oh no! What is it, a hippopotamus!"
"Awww."
"Apu. You can take this job and re-staff it!"
"That baby changed our lives."
"Oooooh! That's one clean tombstone."
"In the garage."
"Yeah, give us a break, Doctor."
"If stuff starts flying, just turn your head."
"Okay, okay, calm down."
"Okay, I will. I will."
"Patty, Selma, what a pleasant surprise."
"... Expiration date: June, 1999... Uh, 2012, yeah."
"Shh! They'll hear you."
"I don't know. Some guy I guess."
"Oh sure, great idea. I'd love to -- Did you hear that?"
"How much?"
"What's the quickest, cheapest, easiest way to do something with you?"
"Anything for my little girl."
"Bart! You can't weld with such a little flame. Stupid kid."
"Ooooooh, McBain."
"Why? I just saw the best part."
"Oooh, ""Death by Knockout,"" ""Blood on the Ice"" Oh, oh... ""Football's Greatest Injuries"". Lisa, we're going."
"Just grab something. All these movies are great."
"Oh great, you made me miss Joe Theisman."
"Oh Marge."
"Uh, let's see, Bart's friends... Well, there's the fat kid with the thing... uh... the little wiener who's always got his hands in his pockets."
"Okay. Hank."
"Hank... Jones."
"Steve McQueen."
"Next."
"Well, he's always chewing on that phone cord."
"Then he has no hobbies."
"Bart!... BART!!!"
"You don't have any hobbies, do you boy?"
"Well, that's what I... Wait a minute. What are you doing?"
"Oh, that's a hobby!"
"Oh, my God. I don't know jack about my boy... I'm a bad father!"
"I'm also fat!"
"I'm Homer Simpson. I just took your test. I got a zero."
"Goodbye, son."
"Ho, ho... if he's as smart as he is funny, I'm sold."
"Well, that's easy for you to say, you preachy egg-headed institute guy. How much do you see your son?"
"Huh?"
"Oh, how I envy you!"
"I've never been afraid of a little hard work."
"What boy?"
"Well, he is building a soapbox derby racer."
"Bart!... I'm gonna help you build that racer."
"Okay. No, I'm gonna do it."
"But you can use me. I'm good. I've built a lot of things around the house... The spice rack... The birdfeeder... The gymboree."
"What was that? Ah, who cares. Son, please let me help you."
"Oh this isn't working at all. It's hopeless... Wait a second."
"Hmm... ""Cosby's first law of intergenerational perversity: No matter what you tell your child to do, he will always do the opposite."" Huh?"
"Oh, that sounds too complicated."
"All right, I will! Son, I don't think you should let me help you."
"Thank you, Bill Cosby, you saved the Simpsons!"
"You know, Marge, that Bart of ours is a little miracle. His winning smile, his button nose, his fat little stomach, his face alight with wholesome mischief... He reminds me of me before the weight of the world crushed my spirit."
"I like our chances, son."
"This is my son and if he doesn't want to wear one you can't make him!"
"Loser-mobile... heh, heh ... wait a minute!"
"Are you nervous son?"
"Okay Bart, we've got a lot of work to do on that car. So, I'm gonna pull you out of school for the next couple of weeks..."
"Bart, the car had a few bugs in it, I admit that. But we're Team Simpson."
"When did I ever teach you that?"
"Don't be, no. Go ahead, leave me. Go on, go on and win. No, go on and win without your dad."
"I'll just sit here in ""Li'l Lightnin'"" -- which the Simpsons built -- and remember that for one brief shining moment, I had a son."
"Ow."
"Why? What's wrong?"
"Oh, sure, I'll take you, wait with you, worry about you, and then you'll ride home with someone who has a faster car. This is how you get your kicks, isn't it, Lisa?"
"Dr. Hibbert, Lisa needs a. You! Homewrecker!"
"No!"
"I'm not pouting, you are."
"Sorry."
"No. Can't think of a thing."
"Leave me alone."
"""Name your son's hobbies."" Building a soapbox racer... ""Name your child's friends."" Martin... Martin! I'll curse that name 'til the day I die... Huh? ""Who is your son's heroe?""..."
"Three-time Soapbox Derby Champion Ronnie Beck!"
"Wow, I'm one question away from being a perfect father. ""Name another dad you talked to about parenting."""
"Shut up Flanders. Flanders!"
"Flanders, Flanders, uh, uh, when should a boy start dating?"
"Great, thanks."
"I talked to Flanders about parenting. I'm a perfect father. Hold on, son, I'm-a coming!"
"Do it for your old man, boy!"
"No, son, you earned it."
"That's my boy. Nyah-nyah, nyah, nyah-nyah-nyah!"
"Wow, infotainment."
"He's not so fat."
"Bart, why are you still up?"
"Boy, they've got better things to talk about than you. Sheesh, what an ego."
"What is it, boy?"
"Is anything the matter, my son? Talk to me, young man."
"Say your name? Why should I do that, my lad?"
"You spoke while you were jinxed so I get to punch you in the arm. Sorry, it's the law. Heh, heh."
"Run for it boy!"
"That's it. I'm outta here."
"What's the matter, Moe?"
"Yeah, things are tough all over."
"Could I get a beer?"
"Hey, I know a good drink. Really hits the spot. I invented it myself..."
"One night Marge's beastly sisters were showing slides from their latest vacation."
"As I stared up at that hairy yellow drumstick, I knew I needed a drink."
"Patty, Selma, would you excuse me for a moment?"
"I decided to mix the little bits that were left in every liquor bottle."
"In my haste I had grabbed a bottle of the kids' cough syrup."
"It passed the first test: I didn't go blind."
"I don't know the scientific explanation, but fire made it good."
"A ""Flaming Homer""."
"Hey Moe, you got any cough syrup?"
"Try lighting it on fire."
"Well, it's called a ""Flaming..."
"Moe, I haven't seen the place this crowded since the government cracked down on you for accepting food stamps. Do you think my drink had something to do with it?"
"Why yes I --"
"I'll tell you what's wrong. That rotten Moe is getting rich off a recipe i gave him!"
"Take that off this second!"
"Nah... Marge, I'm too upset to eat -- I think I'll go to Moe's. ."
"I need to talk to Moe."
"I didn't even tell you my name."
"Homer Simpson."
"But--"
"Barney?"
"You're my kid's teacher!"
"No!"
"Get away from me."
"Hey, Moe?"
"I'd rather have a ""Flaming Homer""."
"How could you do this to me, Moe? This bar was going under and it was the drink I invented that saved it."
"If there was any justice, my face would be on a bunch of crappy merchandise."
"Business, eh? Well let me tell you something. You just lost yourself a customer!"
"I said, you just lost yourself a customer!"
"You just lost yourself a customer."
"You just lost yourself a customer, Moe!"
"You just lost yourself a customer."
"You just lost yourself a customer."
"Ah, my new watering hole."
"A beer?"
"Can I have a clean glass?"
"Stupid Moe... non-inventing... recipe stealing... pug-nosed..."
"Oooh! Look at me, I'm making people happy. I'm the Magical Man from Happyland in a gum drop house on Lollipop Lane!"
"Oh, by the way, I was being sarcastic."
"Moe... Moe... Moe..."
"Moe... Moe... Moe."
"Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe, Moe..."
"Fools! You poor, pathetic, misguided creatures, choking down your Flaming Moe's. All the time wondering, ""How does he do it?"" Well, I'm going tell you. The secret ingredient is..."
"Cough syrup. Nothing but plain, ordinary, over the counter children's cough syrup!"
"Hi, Moe. Where's that waitress of yours?"
"Moe, sorry I lost you hundreds of thousands of dollars."
"I guess so."
"Ahh. Thanks, Moe. You're the greatest friend a guy could ever have."
"Hey, do you think Aerosmith will be in tonight?"
"Oh, what do they want!"
"It's not fair!"
"Uh-huh."
"Ooh, that's a lot of money."
"Uh, Mr. Smithers, do you have change for a dollar?"
"Homer Simpson here."
"I own stock?"
"So uh, how much did it go up?"
"Yeah..."
"Sure..."
"Not any more..."
"That'd be great."
"Well... how are you?"
"Uh-huh. So what's my stock up to?"
"What should I do?"
"Sell! Sell! Sell! Woo hoo! Twenty-five dollars!"
"Ooooh... ooh, hot wax... ooh, hammer..."
"No, I'd like a bottle of Henry K. Duff's Private Reserve."
"For your information, I just made a cool twenty-five dollars playing the market. Buy low, sell high, that's my motto. I may just quit my job at the power plant to become a full-time stock market guy."
"Have a Duff, boys!"
"Hey, you guys aren't from around here, are you?"
"Well, I happen to know that he won't sell it for less than 100 million dollars."
"Hey... hey!"
"You heard?"
"Well, I'm afraid I had some great plans, too."
"I spent it on beer."
"Fifty-two hundred dollars? What are you talking about?"
"What? I sold it all for twenty-five bucks."
"Ow!"
"Did you buy this car with your stock money?"
"We could all lose our jobs."
"Well, they can't fire me."
"Cuz... I..."
"Lucky drunks."
"Yeah! Sock it to him, Horst!"
"Lisa, your father needs your help. Do you know anything about Germany?"
"Good, good, I'm learning."
"Because we send them money?"
"Oh, woa is me."
"Oh, Marge, I'm gonna be fired. I know it."
"Marge, it's not the money. My job is my identity. If I'm not a safety whatchamajigger, I'm nothing."
"Ooh, Battlestar Galactica."
"Fit, damn you! Fit!"
"There."
"Huh? What?"
"Oh, what am I gonna... Hey, you! top being so unsafe! Smitty -- safen-up!"
"No."
"No!"
"Auugghh!"
"Uh... all of them?"
"I sure do!"
"Well, ah, I wish the candy machine wasn't so picky about taking beat-up dollar bills... because a lot of workers really like candy."
"Mmm. The land of chocolate..."
"Wow. Chocolate -- half price!"
"La la la la la..."
"La la la la la la..."
"Oh, oh, oh. I'm sorry. We were talking about chocolate?"
"I think I did pretty good in there."
"Lousy German know-it-alls, who are they to say I'm not safe? Oh what's the matter with this thing."
"No problems here."
"I'm not your buddy, you greedy old reptile!"
"That's right. I lost my job so that you could have another 100 million dollars."
"Let me ask you something. Does your money cheer you up when you're feeling blue?"
"Okay, bad example. So let me ask you this, does your money ever hug you when you come home at night?"
"And does it ever say, ""I love you?"""
"Nobody loves you. Nobody loves you. You're old and you're ugly. Nobody loves you. Yea, yea, yea yea!"
"Nobody loves you..."
"Na na na na / Na na na na /"
"Woo-hoo! I got my job back!"
"But Marge, this one came with a free corncob pipe."
"Well, what color is it? Blue or purple?"
"Oh honey, do you really think you're pregnant?"
"Yeah, and I have the same tightness in my chest and profuse sweating I always get."
"No, everything's fine. Your mother uh, just, broke her leg."
"Maybe."
"Yeah, sure, for you a baby's all fun and games. For me, it's diaper changes and midnight feedings."
"Yeah, but I have to hear about it."
"Actually, Bart, I threw up more than your mother. ... It all happened at the beginning of that turbulent decade known as the '80s."
"Those were idealistic days... The candidacy of John Anderson, the rise of Supertramp... It was an exciting time to be young!"
"For several years I'd been dating your mother and working at the local fun center."
"Yes, sir."
"I was 24 years old, with a beautiful girlfriend and a job with a future..."
"Hey, you're supposed to be listening to my story!"
"Don't you ever, ever talk that way about television. Lousy, ungrateful... Can't keep their, whaddyacallit... minds... on any uh..."
"Where do you think you're going? You're gonna listen to my story."
"Your mother was living with her two wicked sisters."
"You mean like will apes be our masters?"
"But it gives me time to think."
"Well, girls I mean I mean boys. I, I mean you!"
"Wow, what an ending? Who'd have thought Darth Vader was Luke Skywalker's father."
"Marge, you're as pretty as Princess Leia and as smart as Yoda."
"I'll bet the guy she was singing that about was real happy."
"Oh. Well he's always happy. No, wait. He's always mad."
"Someday I'll buy you a real castle."
"Phew, good."
"Really? It must be the Champale talking."
"Don't worry. This castle is impregnable!"
"Pass the cookie dough."
"Y'ello... Oh, hi Marge..."
"Why? What's wrong?"
"Oh."
"... ..."
"Because it's the honorable thing to do?"
"Marge, there's something I want to ask you. But I'm afraid, because if you say no it'll destroy me and make me a criminal."
"Marge, I... Damn it, where's that card?"
"Oh, I wrote down what I was gonna say on a card. Stupid thing must have fallen out of my pocket."
"What's it say?"
"That's the card. Give it here."
"So... will you marry me?"
"Woo hoo! Woo hoo! Yeah! She's gonna marry me. In your face, everybody... Woo hoo!"
"You know, I had this very same discussion with your mother ten years ago."
"Marge, we can't do that! All the kids'll call him Larry Fairy."
"They'll call him Screwy Louie."
"Slob."
"Puke."
"Mucous."
"Let's see... Bart, Cart, Dart, Eeart... Nope, can't see any problem with that. Wow! I'll take that ring!"
"I don't know."
"Finally, the big day came. We didn't have much money, so we went to a quaint little chapel just across the state line."
"Hey! This marriage is gonna last forever."
"Marge, I'm sorry. I wish I could afford a better place."
"I am?"
"Homer."
"I do."
"Our first night together as man and wife."
"Look what I got, Marge, a baby monitor."
"Baby to Marge. Baby to Marge. Wah! Wah! Over."
"Hey, why don't I apply at the nuclear power plant? I hear they pay pretty well."
"Pfft. Now you tell me."
"Dear Marge, XXX. Homer."
"Well... It takes me a long time to learn anything... I'm kind of a goof-off..."
"... Little stuff starts disappearing from the workplace."
"There's a problem with the reactor?! We're all gonna die!!!"
"Nah, they wanted someone good. Story of my life."
"Wow! Kid, I won't let you down."
"I swear to you, when you come out of there, the first thing you're gonna see is a man with a good job."
"... And when ye tallow hardens, we remove it from yon mold."
"Oh!"
"Good evening, Madame. You have been selected by the good people of Slash-Co to reap the benefits of their new Nev-R-Dull knife-edge. Here... shake hands with the Slash-Co."
"Handle first, handle first..."
"I quit! I quit!"
"Me! Me! Me! Me! Me! I said it first!"
"I don't know, I don't know --"
"""Dear Marge... By the time you read this, I will be gone. You deserve all the finest things in the world. And although I can give them to you, they will be repossessed and I will be hunted down like a dog. Also, it has become clear that your family doesn't want me here."""
"I will send you every cent I earn for the baby. But you will not see me again until I am a man."
"Oh, c'mon, honey. You know how it turns out. After all, you wouldn't be here today if I hadn't become the responsible head of a household."
"Okay."
"Big shots with their stainless steel lunchboxes..."
"They get donuts?"
"Wowww."
"Yeah, what do you want?"
"You want fries with that?"
"Marge?"
"Marge!"
"Holy cow, you're as big as a house."
"No, Marge, I just can't. I mean, look at me. I'm a Trainee... They won't even tell me what's in the secret sauce. But I can't buy you a decent wedding ring."
"Marge, for you."
"Oh, sure."
"Because I knocked you up?"
"You the boss?"
"Step aside! I'll deliver this baby!"
"Well, listen to me, Mr. Bigshot... if you're looking for the kind of employee who takes abuse and never sticks up for himself... I'm your man. You can treat me like dirt and I'll still kiss your butt and call it ice cream. And if you don't like it... I can change!!"
"You mean?"
"I got the job. I got the job! Whoo hoo! Only in America could I get a job!"
"Marge!... Marge!..."
"The hospital?"
"Thanks, mom."
"Marge! Marge, where's the baby?"
"Shut up!"
"No, you listen! This is my wife and this is my kid, and I'm paying for this delivery, so if you want to stay, you better give me some respect!"
"Starting tomorrow, I'm a nuclear technician!"
"And tomorrow morning, I'm gonna buy your ring back! Then I'm going house-hunting!"
"Eh, somebody'll cover for me."
"Oh, college boy, eh?"
"Hey, as long as he's got eight fingers and eight toes, he's fine by me."
"Ahh, Bart. Daddy's little angel."
"Why you little... He did that on purpose!"
"Bart, Lisa. Come here for a minute..."
"Y'know, son, the day you were born I received the greatest gift a man could have."
"As the years went by, your mother and I were blessed twice more."
"And not a day goes by that we don't thank God for all three of you."
"Yeah!!! Whoa! Excellent, Marge!"
"Aw, ain't that cute... Hey!"
"Hey! Where in God's name did you learn that kind of... daaaanncciinng!"
"Mon-ey."
"Oh, sorry."
"That could be Bart!"
"He's in for some lovin'."
"Hm... Bart's birthday's coming up."
"Limited?!"
"Do you have any of those microphones left?"
"Y'know, Marge. Bart's really gonna like my birthday present this year. It won't be like those shoe trees I got him last year... or the shelf paper I bought him for Christmas. I'll buy his love yet."
"Bart, I'll bet you think nothin's gonna top that cactus. Well, check out my present!"
"There's only one can of beer left and it's Bart's."
"Hey boy, how's the microphone working?"
"Bart! I would love to get a present like that."
"Listen, boy, this is a great invention! Watch."
"WE GOT A GREAT BIG CON-VOY / ROCKIN' THROUGH THE NIGHT / WE GOT A GREAT BIG CON-VOY / AIN'T SHE A BEAUTIFUL SIGHT / CON-VOY"
"Hey good-lookin', we'll be back for some dinner later!"
"Mmmmm. Chocolate."
"Mmmmm. Chocolate."
"Marge, we need some more vanilla-chocolate-and-strawberry ice cream."
"Mmmmm. Chocolate."
"Why, you little..."
"Wait a minute. Does this mean you like my present?"
"Aww..."
"Just promise me you won't play anymore practical jokes."
"Hey, what's up?"
"Yeah, that Timmy is a real hero."
"Well, he fell down a well... and can't get out..."
"Well, it's more than you did!"
"You must think we're the worst parents in the world."
"Don't worry, son. Just 'cause you're trapped in a hole doesn't mean you can't live a rich full life. I brought you your Krusty doll..."
"Hey, don't make me come down there!"
"Why, you little --"
"It's not our fault. We didn't want the boy, he was an accident."
"Uh, could you edit that last part out?"
"Don't worry, you'll grow into it."
"That's all I can stands, I can't stands no more. I'm gonna get you outta there myself."
"Shh! Marge, he's a good digger."
"Don't worry son, they're gonna make sure no one ever falls down this well again."
"Well, bye-bye belt."
"Pfft, my heart is just fine."
"A little beer will put out that fire."
"Whoo hoo! Denver, yeah!"
"Moe, I'd like to bet twenty dollars on Denver."
"Twenty big ones on Denver."
"All right, Denver. Justify my love."
"Lousy, stupid Denver."
"Why did you do that?"
"Okay, just don't say anything and sit down over there."
"Over."
"Over... over... over..."
"Lisa, please, I can't hear the announcer."
"Why didn't you say that before!"
"Oooh, that's a big lock all right. I just don't trust that guy."
"Huh, they both make a good case."
"Yeah!"
"Line..."
"Yeah, lay it on me, coach."
"Mm-hm."
"Cincinnati..."
"Cincinnati."
"Cincinnati."
"C'mon, c'mon! Don't you realize this is costing me money?"
"Doh, not the wind."
"Oh..."
"... miles per hour."
"Ugh, this is ridiculous. What am I supposed to do? Lisa, who do you think's gonna win? The Bengals or the Dolphins?"
"Good, good. Moe, fifty dollars on the Miami Dolphins."
"All right, Dolphins!"
"Whoo-hoo!"
"Fifty big ones!"
"Uh-oh. You see, Lisa, Daddy's friend Moe promised to give him fifty dollars if the Dolphins won the game."
"Well, I wouldn't call it a bet. It's a little thing Daddies do to make football more exciting."
"Well... you know... you like ice cream, don't you?"
"And don't you like ice cream better when it's covered with hot fudge and mounds of whipped cream and chopped nuts and -- oh -- those crumbled up cookie things they mash up... hmmm. Crumbled up cookie things..."
"That's right. My God, it's like there's some kind of bond between us."
"YEAH!"
"You'd think that wouldn't you. But you see Lisa, your mother has this crazy idea that gambling is wrong. Even though they say it's okay in the Bible."
"Uh... somewhere in the back. The point is we had a great time today. And to keep it that way, let's not tell your mother about our little wager. Okay?"
"You bet."
"Me too, honey."
"Sure! You'll find it gets rid of the unpleasant after-taste of church."
"All right!"
"What? Didn't you hear what he said?"
"You think we should bet against them?"
"You got it."
"Moe, twenty-three dollars on New York."
"Oh, sorry. So who do you like in the afternoon games?"
"My daughter, that's who!"
"Lisa, you've picked the winner every time! You must have some kind of special gift."
"Oh, my little girl says the cutest things."
"Not Sunday -- Daddy-Daughter day."
"The usual, Moe. A beer and a wad of bills."
"I used to hate the smell of your sweaty feet. Now it's the smell of victory."
"Tut-tut. Only the best for my family."
"Hello, I'm Homer. I'll be your customer."
"Oh, violin guy!"
"What's your favorite song, Lisa?"
"Play on."
"Well, Lisa, it's Daddy-Daughter day and Daddy needs daughter's picks."
"You promised you wouldn't get mad!"
"Good, good... You call Moe."
"Barney, are you nuts? That's the Super Bowl. How about the Sunday after that?"
"Not quite. They were out of the Malibu Stacie Lunar Rovers."
"Boy, I know you're gonna like your present."
"All right, Marge. I'll tell you, but first you have to promise you will not get mad."
"All right. If you must know, Lisa and I have been gambling on pro football."
"But Marge, she never loses. She's got a gift. Aren't parents supposed to encourage their kids whenever they show talent?"
"Only in forty-eight states. Besides, it's a victimless crime. The only victim is Moe, heh, heh, heh. And it's brought Lisa and me together."
"Look, what's the problem? The kids are happy, you smell like Meryl Streep, and I've got that foot massager I've always wanted."
"Believe me, Marge, nothing bad could possibly come of this."
"Well, that sounds great honey, but next Sunday I'm going bowling with Barney."
"Don't worry, the new football season is only seven months away."
"Look Lisa, I bought you a Malibu Stacey Chinchilla coat."
"Huh?"
"Look Lisa, honey, I'm sorry I hurt your feelings. But I really had a good time watching football with you. And I think you had a good time with me."
"Well, c'mon, we can still watch the Super Bowl together. Can't we? Eh? Huh?"
"It's a date! So... do you think the Cowboys will beat the spread?"
"Okay."
"Dallas! Whoo-hoo!"
"However? What however? What do you mean, however? However what?"
"Lisa, do me a favor. Complete this sentence: ""Daddy should bet all his money on..."""
"Oh, every note is like a dagger in my heart. I gotta get outta here."
"Don't worry, Moe. I'm not bettin'."
"I had the greatest gift of all, a little girl who could pick football and I ruined it."
"Buffalo's gonna win. Lisa hates me!"
"My daughter."
"Not Duff Dry... Dallas."
"Huh?"
"All right, we're back in business."
"Please, please, please..."
"Yes! She loves me! She loves me!"
"Money comes and money goes, but what I have with my daughter can go on for eight more years!"
"It's beautiful."
"After I catch my breath... can we... go... home?"
"Marge, I split my pants again. Oooh, can I have two sandwiches today? Make them bologna sandwiches too. Can I have two slices of bologna and cheese..."
"Marge, can you take my ball to Nick's today? A bottle cap got lodged in the finger hole."
"Alley balls?"
"Alley balls..."
"Hey sweetheart, what's the matter?! Not gettin' enough of the good stuff at home?"
"Let me through! Let me through! I'm her husband!"
"Hello? Hello? Is this thing on? Hello?"
"What should I say?"
"Yes it's me!"
"I love you very much."
"And uh... later tonight I think you and I should uh, snuggle."
"Look Marge, I can tell something's bothering you. But if you come out of that car, I promise to do whatever it takes to make it better. Please, honey?"
"Well, all's well that ends well. Goodnight, Marge."
"Whaa..."
"What? But Marge, we just had a vacation. Remember Mystic Caverns?"
"I know you do, Marge. But come on, you know what our vacations are like. Those three monsters in the back seat. ""Are we there yet? Are we there yet?"" And let's face it, I'm no day at the beach either. ""Marge, can I have another sandwich? Marge, can I have another sandwich?"""
"What? You mean we're getting a divorce? Marge, I can change!"
"Well, okay. But you have to swear you're comin' back."
"All right then."
"She's startin' to give."
"For your information, I can take care of my --"
"See? Got her on the first bounce."
"Good bye? Where's my clean underwear?"
"How often should I change Maggie?"
"Marge, Marge, how do I use the pressure cooker?"
"Hello Maggie."
"Sorry, honey, mommy went crazy...And went far, far away..."
"So, it's going to be just you and me for awhile. Just you and me."
"C'mon, Maggie. Nummy, nummy num."
"Mmm. Strained peas."
"Let go!"
"Hi Barney. Thanks for keeping me company."
"All right, but just be careful."
"GO TO SLEEP AND GOODNIGHT/ DA DA DA / DA DA DA DA DA DA DA DA/ DEE DEE DEE / DEE DEE / May your Christmas day be nice. Goodnight, my little pork chop."
"Oh Maggie, time for your nine a.m. feeding."
"Heh, heh, heh."
"Maggie?"
"Maggie?"
"Maggie?"
"Maggie?"
"Maggieeee!!!!"
"Barney, I've lost the baby. It's the worst thing I've ever done."
"Just help me look!"
"C'mon!"
"Barney! You're gonna pull her arm off."
"Hello... I'd like the department of missing babies."
"I came to see the kids."
"Hmmm."
"Hey kids... uh... you haven't seen Maggie around anyplace have you?"
"Well, I gotta go."
"Y'ello."
"Listen, Marge, uh, how would you feel if I told you the dog ran away?"
"Oh. Well, I've got good news for you. The dog didn't run away."
"Now, Marge. Maggie was very young. It's not like we got so attached to her. No. Marge, isn't life funny? One day they're babies, the next thing you know, they're off on their own. Oh."
"Yes."
"Uh... she's small... she's a girl..."
"Oh Maggie!"
"You found my baby. Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you!"
"You're not going anywhere."
"Never leave again... never leave again... never leave again."
"You got it, sweetheart. You have enough blanket there?"
"Marge. Come here."
"Can you believe it? Pretty soon I'll be able to quit my job and live off the boy."
"Marge, dogs love the outdoors."
"Yeah, but what're ya gonna do?"
"Marge, you're a tool of the dog house makers."
"Yes you are. You've been brainwashed by all those dog house commercials on TV. I know, I'll build him a dog house."
"Don't worry. I just drew up a little blueprint. Now let me walk you through it."
"This is the door. He goes through that. This is the roof. And this happy character here is the sun. He shines down on the house, see."
"Stupid lumber..."
"Dammit! Son of a --"
"The hell with this!"
"""Maybe it's the beer talking, Marge, but you've got a butt that won't quit. They got those big chewy pretzels here... ... five dollars? Get outta here."""
"Damn, crappy nails! Super glue my butt!"
"What is it, Flanders?"
"Look, if this is about your camcorder -- I lost it, okay?"
"What the hell are you talking about?"
"Oh come on now, Flanders, I don't complain about your your... moustache."
"Makes you look like you've got something to hide."
"People are talking... lots of people."
"Aye-aye! Admiral Butthead."
"Hey Marge, do you want to hear something funny? Flanders thinks I swear too much. Marge, you're not laughing."
"Well what a surprise. Marge sticks up for Flanders! Can we have one conversation where you don't bring up your hero, Ned Flanders?"
"Look, we're past that. Marge, maybe I do curse a little, but that's the way God made me. And I'm too old to stop now."
"Well Marge, self-improvement has always been a passion of mine. Bring on the swear jar."
"Do I have to pay if I hit my hand with the hammer?"
"What if I catch on fire?"
"What if I see something really weird in the sky?"
"What about when we snuggle?"
"God --"
"Ohh, you son-of-a."
"You dirty bas..."
"What do ya think, Lisa?"
"Well, he just goes... Ohhh"
"Oh fudge, that's broken."
"Fiddle dee dee. That will require a tetanus shot. I'm not going to swear, but I am going to kick this doghouse down."
"Where'd you get the money?"
"Maggie. Oh. Cute."
"Beer! How did you know?"
"Bart, this is your teacher? I should start going to parents night."
"Boy, you've got to go to your teacher and tell her the truth."
"Oh, Marge. I only said it because I thought that's what you wanted to hear."
"Step aside everyone. Sensitive love letters are my specialty."
"""Dear Baby, welcome to Dumpville. Population: you."""
"I may hold you to that, Marge."
"Three simple words. I am gay."
"P.S. -- I am gay."
"How about, ""With a love that will echo through the ages?"""
"Why you little..."
"Mmm, do - nuts."
"Don't tell me how to eat donuts --"
"Softball?"
"Who's next?"
"What's the matter with you guys?"
"Look, I know it wasn't our best season."
"Well, this year's gonna be different."
"I have a secret weapon."
"Come here boy, I want to show you something."
"It's something very special. A home-made bat. It all started last year, during a terrible thunderstorm, when I locked myself out of the house..."
"Sheltering myself with a large piece of sheet metal, I ran for cover under the tallest tree I could find."
"Something told me this was a very special, very magical, piece of wood that I could make a bat out of."
"I put my homemade football on hold and set to work making the world's greatest bat."
"And here it is."
"Let's see... we play thirty games... ten at bats a game... three thousand."
"Check it out, boys. My magic bat."
"Yeah, just watch."
"Woo hoooooo!"
"Ha ha. Cops can't win!"
"Kids, kids, kids. You can each get me a beer. But first let's see it again in super slow motion."
"I did! Whoo-hoo! Whoo-hoo! In your face, Strawberry!"
"You're Darryl Strawberry."
"You play right field."
"I play right field too."
"Well, are you better than me?"
"It's not fair. Me and the guys worked so hard to get to the championship game and now we'll be sitting on a bench."
"Marge, forget it. He's bigger than me, faster than me, stronger than me and he already has more friends around the plant than I do."
"Well now that you're a little bit older, I can tell you that's a crock. No matter how good you are at something, there's always about a million people better than you."
"I got it! I got it!"
"Hey, I called for that!"
"No."
"These guys aren't so tough. I've got ""Wonder Bat."""
"Please, please, please, I want to make the team. Clemens, did I make the team?"
"One thing I'm good at and I can't do it anymore."
"Like what?"
"Yeah, but none of my friends can watch me."
"Where do you think you're going?"
"No, no, no! I don't want you to see me sitting on my butt."
"They're gonna win the championship, no thanks to me."
"I am? Whoo-hoo!"
"Yes."
"Uh uh."
"Got it."
"Yes, sir!"
"Huh?"
"Lurleen."
"Good one, Lenny."
"So what're you gonna be, boy?"
"No, the Army said I was too heavy. The police said I was too dumb."
"Wait a minute. Isn't anybody gonna follow in my footsteps?"
"Stupid fingers."
"Look, I didn't steal that copper wire. I just thought they were throwing it out. Here, take it."
"Good for you. Maybe this'll straighten the boy out."
"We always have one good kid and one lousy kid. Why can't both our kids be good?"
"Maaarge... The dog doesn't count as a kid."
"Oh yeah."
"Yeah!"
"One hundred and thirty million dollars!"
"Bart, I need some lucky numbers, fast! How old are you? Uh-huh, and what's your birthday? No kidding. And what's Lisa's birthday?... What? You don't know your sister's birthday? What kind of brother are you?"
"You'll never guess what happened Marge! Are you ready? I... have... a feeling... that we may win... the lottery!"
"I know you're excited, but calm down and listen to me carefully. Go-get-all-your-money..."
"You don't understand, Marge. The lottery is the one ray of hope in my otherwise unbearable life. Uh, the lottery and you."
"Yes, Money... I mean Honey. Ooooh! Here comes a news report about the lottery!"
"Hey, down in front."
"Whoo-hoo!"
"I've never been so sure of anything in my life. I am going to win this lottery."
"Correction. Three hundred and eighty million to fifty. So what are you gonna do with your share of the money, kids?"
"What do kids know about spending money?"
"Hmm..."
"Look closer, Lenny!"
"Fourteen carat gold!"
"Take a hike boss, I'm running things now."
"I've got so many tickets I can't lose!"
"Receipts, ugh."
"Well why didn't you tell the rest of us? Why did you keep it a secret??? If you were seventeen, we'd be rich! But no! You had to be ""10."""
"Dad, you shouldn't say the dog's dead when he's not."
"Hey, you did the best you could."
"Well... I guess we'll have to talk it over."
"Uh... later. First, I want to tell you about the most wonderful place in the world... Doggie Heaven."
"In Doggie Heaven, there's mountains of bones and they can't turn around without sniffing another dog's butt! And all the best dogs are there. Old Yeller... and about eight Lassies and..."
"Well... of course. There couldn't be a heaven if there weren't a hell."
"Uh... Hitler's dog... and that dog Nixon had... whassisname... uh... Chester."
"Yeah. And one of the Lassies is in there too. The mean one. The one that mauled Timmy."
"But it'll be okay... we'll get him a new dog... one with an untwistable stomach..."
"Oh, come on! I'm sorry, but we just can't afford it. Marge, make him stop."
"All right. All right. We'll find a way. Lousy manipulative dog."
"Uh... Mr. Burns... I need to borrow some money."
"I know you're a good man... and I have a dog that's very sick..."
"I thought maybe you..."
"Oh. Well, thanks for your time."
"What?"
"But Marge! It looks so easy! Just like carving a turkey."
"Maybe you're right, Marge."
"Whattaya got, Marge? Insurance scam?"
"Chub? I don't even know what that is!"
"Marge, I've figured out an alternative to giving up my beer. Basically, we become a family of traveling acrobats..."
"Lousy chub night. Hey, how come he gets meat and we don't?"
"Mmm... snouts."
"Well, he's got all the money in the world, but there's one thing he can't buy."
"A dinosaur."
"BUFFALO GALS WON'T YOU COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT / COME OUT TONIGHT... OH BUFFALO GALS..."
"AND DANCE BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOONNNNNNNN!"
"My quarter!!!"
"I know you can't understand me, but you're a lousy dog and I hate you."
"Yes."
"Oh, you mean tonight."
"Bart! Close the gate."
"Oh he's gone and he's never coming back. Wait! There he is. No... that's a horse."
"Uh...the last one."
"That was his dish, and that was his leash, and that's where he took a whiz on the rug."
"Oh, Marge! There is no such place!"
"Or... to put it another way... there is."
"And I'll be right here watching TV."
"Two tickets for..."
"Let me pet him again!"
"I know. I want to pet him again!"
"The cat? What's the point?"
"Oooh, there's a good one."
"Marge, that's just a suggested car size."
"Easy... easy... How'm I doing on the right?"
"Uh huh... easy... easy... perfect. All right, everybody out the window."
"Ooh, they all look great."
"""Look Who's Oinking""! ""Look Who's Oinking""!"
"That's right."
"Why Marge, you frisky little devil."
"We'll take two tickets to ""The Stockholm Affair."""
"""Political""!"
"Ah, this movie's too complicated... Hey, the floor's sticky..."
"Who's that guy?... What did that guy say when I said, ""Who's that guy?"""
"Oh, that submarine's so fake... Look, you can see the strings... Ooh! An octopus!"
"What?"
"I think that guy's a spy."
"Oh wait, I heard how this ends. It turns out the secret code was the same nursery rhyme he told his daughter."
"Hey, it's pretty obvious if you think about it."
"Marge, I have always carried myself with a certain quiet dignity. Tonight you robbed me of it. I'm going now and I don't know when you'll see me again."
"Mmm..."
"Ew, a skunk!"
"Oh no."
"Ooh, a redneck bar."
"Duff please."
"Okay, Fudd me."
"Stupid Marge tell me to shut up."
"Yeah..."
"... that's true."
"Uh-huh."
"That's right, except for the pick-up truck."
"Oh, no. I went to this bar the other night, and they..."
"Hey... Hey, Lurleen! I've gotta say somethin' to ya."
"Your song touched me in a way I've never felt before. And which way to the can?"
"Homer J. Simpson."
"That's a pretty name."
"Maybe. I'm not sure. I forgot it."
"Bye Lurleen."
"Y'ello."
"I was just up at this bar in Spittle County."
"Marge, let's end this feudin' and a fussin' and get down to some lovin'."
"I WORK ALL DAY FOR SOME OLD MAN/ I SWEAT AND BREAK MY BACK/"
"YOUR WIFE DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU/ BUT I DO..."
"Hey Moe, you got any Fudd?"
"Moe, I was a hundred miles outta town."
"Lurleen, I can't get your song outta my mind. I haven't felt this way since ""Funky Town."""
"Do you think I could get a copy of it?"
"Lurleen, we've gotta crack open your head and scoop out those songs!"
"Come with me!"
"I guess so."
"Shut up, boy. Marge, what do you think?"
"Well, right now she's an out-of-work cocktail waitress. But she's going to be a country music superstar like... uh... that jerk in the cowboy hat... and that dead lady."
"Marge, you make it sound so seamy. All I did was spend the afternoon in her trailer watching her try on some outfits."
"Well hi, Lurleen. We were just talking about you. Uh... I think I can come over. Let me ask my wife."
"It's a date!"
"Don't thank me, Lurleen, you should be thanking your brain."
"Well, I was going to ask you for a glass of water, but now I feel kinda guilty about it."
"Thanks. You did say sugar, right?"
"Really? Well, I should warn you... I'm not great with figures..."
"I make a lot of stupid decisions..."
"I did bad in school."
"My personal hygiene has been described as..."
"Marge, look at me."
"Uh, then maybe you better not look at me."
"A friend bought it for me."
"No... I think it was Lenny."
"No!"
"No!"
"A coupla times."
"I can't. I'm her manager."
"Marge, you're standing in the way of my boyhood dream of managing a beautiful country singer."
"Marge, Lurleen's gonna be a big success and whether you like it or not, I'm going to be there."
"I'm sure Lurleen will love it."
"Calm down, Marge, it's just our life savings. I'm not going to go into hock for this."
"Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen."
"I don't have time to answer all these questions. Uh, time is money. Come on, people!"
"Stop it."
"You, off the bench."
"Guess what, Lurleen, I got you a gig on TV."
"Hey! Oh, you meant that as a compliment. Now on this show, they want you to sing two songs. Maybe we should give them something new."
"Let's hear it."
"Oh, that's hot. There isn't a man alive who wouldn't get turned on by that. Well, g'bye."
"Uh-huh..."
"Right..."
"Uh... I gotta think about this."
"Later, Marge. Lurleen's on TV tonight. I gotta get ready."
"That's great, honey. Say, have you seen my rattlesnake hatband?"
"Sure they will."
"Uh... I gotta go."
"Yes I am."
"Forget it, pal. They don't call me Colonel Homer because I'm some dumb-ass army guy."
"Lurleen, they loved you."
"Is there anything you need?"
"My whole romantic life is flashing before my eyes."
"At least could I have my dollar ba..."
"I'm sorry Lurleen. All I wanted to do was share your beautiful voice with other people and I've done that. Now I better get out of here before I lose my family."
"Just so I don't wonder... You would've gone all the way with me, wouldn't you?"
"Okay."
"Now before we negotiate, I have to tell you I'm desperate to unload Lurleen. And I'll take any offer."
"You son of a... Sold!"
"Is there any room in that bed for a dad-burn fool?"
"Look Maggie, they have a baby, too."
"Pfft."
"Ooooh."
"Gee, if some snot-nosed little kid sent me to prison, the first thing out, I'd find out where he lives, and tear him a new bellybutton."
"Lousy snitch."
"I am not."
"Hear hear!."
"Oooh, appetizers."
"Well, you can't go wrong with cocktail weenies. They taste as good as they look. And they come in this delicious red sauce. It looks like catsup -- it tastes like ketchup. But brother it ain't ketchup!"
"Oh, would you two knock it off? I hate all the programs Marge likes. But it's no big deal. You know why?"
"Whenever Marge puts on one of her nonviolent programs, I take a walk. I go to a bar, I down a few, and I stumble home in the mood for love."
"Hey, Wiener Boy... Where do you think you're going?"
"Hey, and after we watch this, we can tape over it."
"Hey, down in front."
"Come again?"
"To the Simpson mobile!"
"Wow, my concert going jacket still fits. And this is where I used to hide my beer."
"Billy Beer!"
"Oh Marge, I went to thousands of heavy metal concerts and it never hurt me."
"I hear ya. Come on boy."
"Now, just meet me back here after the show."
"Boy, some of the best times I've ever had were in the back seat of a car."
"Oh, Baby!"
"THERE WAS A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA... A RECORD STAR HE THOUGHT HE'D BE... HE HEARD OF SINGERS LIKE BEATLES... THE CHIPMUNKS HE'D SEEN ON TV... WHY NOT A LITTLE SPANISH FLEA? AND SO HE HID... INSIDE A DOG..."
"I'll be right back."
"Well, that's a waste of money. We already have a guitar."
"This is real."
"Now boy, we spent a lot of money. So you better get real good real fast or pow!"
"Hey, I thought I was supposed to encourage him."
"Marge, what were you thinking?"
"Oh, everybody says that when they hear themselves on tape."
"Forget it. That line didn't work for my dad and it's not gonna work for you."
"Yes, but doesn't the Bible also say, ""Thou shalt not take moochers into thy... hut""?"
"All right. He can stay. But I get to treat him like garbage."
"Will you knock it off! I can't hear myself think."
"That's better. Hey, how come you never play your guitar anymore?"
"Son, come here. Heh, heh, heh. Of course I'm not mad. If something's hard to do, then it's not worth doing. You just stick that guitar in the closet next to your short wave radio, your karate outfit, and your unicycle and we'll go inside and watch TV."
"It doesn't matter."
"Open up! Open up! I gotta go and no fooling."
"That guy has gotta go."
"That's it. He's outta here."
"I don't care. This is not ""Happy Days"" and he is not the Fonz."
"Listen you drain clogging, last cookie-eating, collect call-getting sponge, I want you out of my house!"
"Why you little..."
"What the..."
"So long stomach. We've had a lot of great memories."
"This sucks. Where is that channel changer?"
"Oh, eh, I'll give it a chance."
"Chocolate..."
"Ooh, sweet."
"I'd say ""You're a lying scumbag."" Why sweetie?"
"Oh Lisa, that's a load of rich, creamery butter."
"Lose weight and listen to new-age music? Wow! What do you think, Marge?"
"Listen, Tabouli, we're ignoring all of your demands. What do you say to that?"
"Lamentably, no. My gastronomic rapacity knows no satiety."
"Forbearance is the watchword. That triumvirate of Twinkies merely overwhelmed my resolve."
"Tut tut, gentle Marge. For here in the boudoir, the gourmand metamorphasizes into the voluptuary!"
"Now there's a Machiavellian countenance."
"Ooh...a sextet of ale."
"Nah."
"The vernal equinox?"
"Disingenuous mountebanks with their subliminal chicanery! A pox on them!"
"Marge, where's that... metal dealie... you use to... dig... food."
"Yuh. Yuh. Yuh."
"Yeah that's good."
"Forgot there was a physical today, huh?"
"Go to hell."
"Oh, the usual. Stand in front of this, open that, pull down this, bend over, spread apart that, turn your head that way, cough..."
"Herb?"
"What the hell are you two..."
"Oh, my couch! The arms, the seat... the dream is over. All right, who did this?"
"Well, why did this have to happen now, during primetime, when TV's brightest stars come out to shine!?"
"Oh, goodbye, old girl. We've had a lot of great memories."
"Boring."
"Well friend, you're going back where you came from. The curb in front of Flanders' house."
"Yeah. You know, my life just can't get any worse."
"That's right. There's no way my life could possibly get any worse."
"Would I!"
"Wait a minute. I'm not signing anything until I read it, or somebody gives me the gist of it."
"Don't I get some kind of trophy? At a big award ceremony?"
"Herb!"
"Please please please please please..."
"Don't jinx it!"
"Oh, my God!! Woo hoo! I win!"
"I miss my couch."
"Pfft! Heavyweight championship. There's like three of those. That couch was one of a kind."
"I think I'm gonna take a walk."
"I feel so empty. So alone, so... couchless."
"Wow. The Spine Melter 2000."
"Give me full power."
"Dammit, I said full power!"
"I'll take it."
"Marge, there's an empty spot I've always had inside me. I tried to fill it with family, religion, community service. But those were dead ends. I think this chair is the answer."
"All right, we won't get the chair. Now excuse me while I kiss the sky."
"They're singing again. Lousy neighbors. Wish I was deaf."
"You weren't so glad to see me."
"Well, while you're a guest in my home, could you just kick me in the butt?"
"Herb, let me give you the grand tour. This is one of our many light switches. It functions in both the on and off mode."
"On... off... on... off."
"Oh, yeah. Right. I don't know what this switch does."
"They do good work."
"Broke again, eh Herb? Just like in real life. I guess you're just not much of a businessman."
"Wait, Marge. Didn't you want to spend that money on a vibrating chair?"
"Nah."
"Twenty minutes?!"
"It's drinking the water!"
"This is the greatest invention in the world! You'll make a million dollars!"
"It's going back for more!"
"All right, Herb, I'll lend you the two thousand bucks. But you have to forgive me and treat me like a brother."
"Okay, then just give me the drinking bird."
"Herb, this is the stupidest thing I've ever seen. I can't believe we blew two thousand bucks on it, when right now rollers could be kneading my buttocks."
"I try, but I can't."
"Never mind."
"I dunno, Herb. People are afraid of new things. You should have taken an existing product and put a clock in it or something."
"I gave Herb all the money I had in the world... and still he treats me like something he dug out of his ear."
"Well, when is he gonna act like it?"
"Herb, I don't think there's a vibrating chair in that bag for me."
"What do I get? What do I get? It's not another punch in the face is it? Because if it is, I don't want it."
"That's it?"
"I see your point, brother."
"All right... but I never really hugged a man before."
"Wake up, boy."
"Well it is."
"Sure do. When you're eighteen, you're out the door."
"Now listen, boy. We have an understanding and you'd better keep your end of it. I don't think I'd be any kind of a father if you got D's and I let you go to Kamp Krusty."
"Son, if you really want something in this life you have to work for it. Now quiet, they're about to announce the lottery numbers."
"Woo-hoo!"
"Stupid roller-skate."
"A+? You don't think much of me, do you boy?"
"You know a D turns into a B so easily. You just got greedy."
"Now, Bart. We made this deal because I thought it would help you get good grades. And you didn't. But why should you pay for my mistake?"
"Yeah. I didn't want you hangin' around all summer anyway."
"Thanks son. Now, you've got little hands. Can you reach under that mower and pull out that skate?"
"Marge, am I crazy, or is my back getting hairier?"
"I don't see your name on it, boy."
"Oh yeah?"
"Check... mate."
"""Leaves of 4, eat some more."""
"Oh no you're not."
"He-he-he."
"Marge, since the kids left, I lost five pounds!"
"And look. New hair!"
"I'm this close to having a comb-over!"
"Size... right... agility!"
"Ah, kids' letters from camp."
"Marge, we've got all the fireworks we need right here."
"Sounds interesting."
"Sounds interesting."
"A beaut from Butte."
"Nothin' could be finah."
"She, uh... Good for her."
"Marge keep it down in there."
"Maggie! Cut that racket!"
"And where exactly are you going?"
"Well, this is the first I've heard about it."
"Excuse me, Marge. I think that if you told me I would remember! I mean I'm not an idiot!"
"Kids, back me up."
"Match point, Homer."
"That's okay. We're none of us perfect."
"Bart, don't ask stupid questions. Is there any frontal nudity?"
"Make Bart do it."
"You see, Marge, while you're off in your little world, you forgot that other people have problems too."
"Marge, your ride's here."
"Marge, can I get some change for the candy machine?"
"Hey, there's quarters in here!"
"Woo-hoo! Come to papa! Marge, I'll be out in the car."
"Marge, move it or lose it!"
"Salt me."
"Wha th... Why are you talking like that?"
"I'm livin' in a cuckoo clock."
"But Marge, what about dessert?"
"Fine. I will!"
"Oh no! My pudding is trapped forever. So I can open my own can of pudding, can I? Shows what you know, Marge!"
"Maaaarge! Hey, Maaaaaarrrrge!"
"So what time does this play start?"
"Well I gotta, don't I?"
"Probably not much of it."
"Because I don't care, okay? I can't fake an interest in this, and I'm an expert at faking an interest in your kooky projects."
"You know, the painting class, the First Aid course, that whole Lamaze thing."
"You know I would never do anything to hurt your feelings. Good night."
"Maggie, time to go to the..."
"Babies."
"Huh?"
"Kids, wait in the car. I want to talk to your mother about this play thing."
"Shut up boy."
"Marge, you were terrific."
"I wasn't bored. I was sad. It really got to me how that lady -- Uh... uh... you know which one I mean. You played her."
"Yeah. How Blanche was sad and how that guy Stanley -- should have been nice to her."
"I mean it made me feel bad. The poor thing ends up being hauled to the nut house when all she needed was for that big slob to show her some respect. At least that's what I thought. I have a history of missing the point of stuff like this."
"Hey, you know. I'm a lot like that guy."
"Yeah, like when I pick my teeth with the mail and stuff..."
"Ahhh, another beautiful day in the womb. La-la-la-la--la-... ...la-la-la... la-la-la..."
"Leggo! Leggo!"
"I'm all naked and wet!"
"Don' wanna go."
"Too cold out!"
"Oh, stupid itchy church pants..."
"One size fits all, my butt!"
"Forget it. I'm not going."
"Ahhh. I'm just a big toasty cinnamon bun. I never want to leave this bed. Uh-oh. Gotta take a whiz. Think, man, think... think, think, think. I better get up."
"I'm whizzing with the door open -- and I love it!"
"Whyyy, oh whyyy... Delilahhh?"
"You bet your sweet... ass!"
"I wear short shorts!"
"The perfect chance to make my patented, space age, out-of-this-world Moon Waffles."
"Let's see here... caramels, waffle batter...liquid smoke..."
"Oooh, waffle run off."
"Mmm, fattening."
"Uh-oh. Here, boy."
"Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay."
"I know that!"
"Hello, this is Homer Simpson."
"""This Things I Believe""."
"Woo-hoo!"
"Heh-heh-heh... Moe is their leader."
"Come on TV... gimme some of that sweet, sweet pap!"
"Oh, well... can't win 'em all."
"Yesss!"
"Woo-hoo!"
"Is that what I think it is?"
"I... found... a penny!"
"Could this be the best day of my life?"
"Looks like we have a new champion."
"Ah, my beloved family. How was church?"
"I, on the other hand, have been having the best day of my life. And I owe it all to skipping church!"
"Like fun I don't. Marge, I'm never going to church again."
"No! No, no, no, no, no, no. Well, yes."
"Hey, what's the big deal about going to some building every Sunday? I mean, isn't God everywhere?"
"And don't you think that the Almighty has better things to worry about than where one little guy spends one measly hour of his week?"
"And what if we picked the wrong religion? Every week we're just making God madder and madder."
"Marge, come to bed."
"Maarge... come to bed Marge..."
"It's good for what ails ya..."
"I can wait all --"
"God?"
"Well... kind of... but..."
"And YOU remember... Matthew... 21:17."
"I'm not a bad guy. I work hard and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to hell?"
"No. They moved to Phoenix."
"You know what I really hate about church? Those boring sermons."
"Give him one for me."
"So I figure I should just try to live right, and worship you in my own way."
"Sure, honey."
"Don't worry, Sweetheart. If I'm wrong, I'll recant on my deathbed."
"Hello, my animal friends. Peace be with you."
"Guys, please, could you give me five minutes?"
"Well, I wasn't sure I was doing the right thing. But then God Himself told me I should seek a new path."
"Yeah, he appeared before me in a dream, and I knew that was special 'cause I usually dream about naked... Marge."
"Perfect teeth - nice smell - a class act all the way."
"Yeah... think about it."
"Hello, work? This is Homer Simpson. I won't be coming in tomorrow -- Religious holiday... The uh, Feast of... Maximum Occupancy."
"Well, you should join my religion, Moe. It's great. No Hell... no kneeling...."
"No sale."
"Leave me alone!"
"Where are we going?"
"Kids, let me tell you about another so-called wicked guy. He had long hair and some ""wild"" ideas and he didn't always do what other people thought was right. And that man's name was... I forget. But the point is... uh, I forget that too. Marge, you know who I'm talking about -- he used to drive that blue car --"
"There you go again. Always taking someone else's side. Flanders... the water department... God..."
"Very sure."
"Ooh! An interview with Lorne Michaels... wait, that's no good. Hey, now we're talkin'. ""Our Unabashed Dictionary defines IUD as 'Love Springs Internal'."" I don't get it."
"Wait a minute, is this a religious thing?"
"Sorry."
"Apu, I see you're not in church."
"Hey Ganesha, want a peanut?"
"No offense Apu, but when they were handing out religions, you must have been out takin' a whiz."
"Boy, everyone is stupid except me."
"Marge, turn down the heat. That's better."
"Fire! What do I do? What do I do? Oh, the song! The song! WHEN A FIRE STARTS TO BURN / THERE'S A LESSON YOU MUST LEARN / SOMETHING... SOMETHING, THEN YOU'LL SEE/YOU'LL AVOID CATASTROPHE!"
"Flanders, you saved me. Why?"
"That's right, old friend."
"My Magazines and roach traps... gone, all gone."
"Hey, wait a minute... Flanders is a regular Charlie Church and God didn't save his house!"
"Well, the Picasso... my collection of classic cars..."
"Well, that's just great."
"You know, I have a feeling there's a lesson here."
"No, don't tell me, I'll get it... Oh, I know! The Lord is vengeful! O Spiteful One! Show me who to smite, and they shall be smoten!"
"I was rude to every one of you... and you saved my life, when you could have just left me to fry, like the proverbial pancake that I am."
"I'll be there next Sunday. Front row, center!"
"God, I gotta ask you somethin'. What's the meaning of life?"
"C'mon."
"I can't wait that long."
"No, tell me now!"
"Ha, ha, you lose! 36 and 239!"
"A ride on the Duff Blimp..."
"Wow."
"Ho-mer, Ho-mer, Ho-mer.."
"Oh, it's no fair. We'll never have a buffer."
"Well, I want that one."
"Oh my God!"
"HEY THERE BLIMPY BOY /FLYING THROUGH THE SKY SO FANCY FREE."
"Honey, what's wrong?"
"What are you talking about?"
"Heh heh heh... Oh, Lisa, this isn't real. It's just how you might look if you were a cartoon character."
"Now that's not true! You're cute as a bug's ear."
"Dad, am I cute as a bug's ear?"
"There, see?"
"Moe, have you ever felt unattractive?"
"How about you, Barney?"
"I need help."
"Lisa's age seven to nine!"
"That could be Lisa!"
"Hey, Barney, will you give me 250 bucks for this blimp ticket?"
"Where'd you get all the money?"
"Lisa, if you could have one wish, what would it be?"
"Uh, was your second wish to be entered in the Little Miss Springfield Pageant?"
"I sent in an application for you. I couldn't find a big enough photo, so I sent in that funny drawing of you on roller skates."
"But I think she'll win."
"Hey, nobody's prettier than my little girl."
"Well, if I could gouge out somebody else's eyes and shove them into my sockets, I would. But to me, she's beautiful."
"Hey there blimpy boy Flying through the sky so fancy free --"
"Boy, when Lisa comes in, I want you to make a big fuss over how she looks."
"No, she won't. When it comes to compliments, women are ravenous, blood-sucking monsters, always wantin' more, MORE! MORE! And if you give it to 'em, you'll get plenty back in return."
"I'll tell you when you're older."
"Is that Lisa? Ooh, I gotta call heaven -- there's an angel missing!"
"Hey... hey!"
"Nope, that's it."
"Yeah! Clean up this stink hole!"
"They'll love you just as much as I do."
"Hmmm."
"Bless you boys."
"I know."
"If it wasn't for me you'd still be queen. You must hate me."
"I don't know. Was I drunk?"
"Really?"
"Will you remember this the next"
"time I wreck your life?"
"Oh yeah? With what?"
"I mean don't worry, son. I forgot to get you a present. But I swear on my father's grave..."
"I will get you one now!"
"Do you sell toys?"
"Well, I need something for my son's birthday."
"Ooh, that's bad."
"That's good."
"That's bad."
"That's good."
"Can I go now?"
"Happy birthday, son!"
"Woo hoo!"
"Didn't even pull the string that time."
"That doll tried to kill me!"
"Don't leave me alone with him."
"MY BALONEY HAS A FIRST NAME / IS H-O-M-E-R / MY BALONEY HAS A SECOND NAME / IT'S H-O-M-E-R."
"Goodbye, Dolly."
"And that is that."
"Marge, Marge, look!"
"The doll's trying to kill me and the toaster's been laughing at me!"
"Ew. Dog water."
"Come here you."
"Did you walk the dog?"
"Yeah, dogs like to bury old junk."
"... So then, his wife comes through the door!!!"
"Did I mention she was dead?"
"Well, she was. And she hit him in the head with a golf club!"
"Don't you remember? He went golfing all the time and it really bugged her."
"Ooo."
"Did you wreck the car?"
"Did you raise the dead?"
"But the car is okay?"
"All right then."
"Why? Oh, the zombies. No."
"Spare my family. Take me. Take me!"
"To the book depository!"
"He was a zombie?"
"I'm a-comin' boy!"
"Barney! Not you, too!"
"Take that Washington!"
"Eat lead, Einstein!"
"Show's over, Shakespeare!"
"Man... fall down. Funny."
"Well that depends on what your teachers say. If you've been good... pizza. If you've been bad... uh... ... let's see... poison."
"Oh no. I'm not making two stops."
"All right, I'll talk to Lisa's teacher this year. You can have Bart's."
"All right. Tell you what. I'm thinking of a number between one and 50."
"I mean, no."
"Please Marge... please, please, please, please, please?"
"Woo hoo! U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!"
"Hee hee!"
"I did. I did read to her!"
"Eight o'clock... Happy Days. The Fonz, Henry Winkler, is worried he's losing his cool."
"Well, I've always been a firm believer in the three ""R's"": ""reading TV Guide""... ummmm, writing to TV Guide... and renewing TV Guide."
"""My child is on the Honor Roll at Springfield Elementary."" You know, I never thought I'd find a replacement for my ""Where's the Beef"" bumper sticker. Heh, heh, heh... ""Where's the Beef""."
"Huh? Oh."
"Bus-ted!"
"Are you kidding? Lisa turned out perfect. I won't stand here and listen to you bad-mouthing Lisa!"
"Oh. That guy."
"He's the boy you love to hate."
"Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. What great men he would join. John Marshall... Charles Evans Hughes... Warren Burger... mmm burger."
"If you don't start making more sense we're gonna have to put you in a home."
"Then we'll put you in the crooked home we saw on ""60 Minutes."""
"Dad, you and your stories... ""Bart broke my teeth""... ""the nurses are stealing my money""... ""this thing on my neck is getting bigger""..."
"But Marge, look at that hangdog expression. He's learned his lesson. Let's get him a present."
"All right, all right. Young man, since you broke Grampa's teeth -- he gets to break yours."
"Bart, don't tell your mother, but I brought you some pizza."
"Just promise me you'll try to be good."
"Thataboy."
"Bart, did you take out the garbage like I asked?"
"Hey you goats, get outta here!"
"Boy, you're going to have to be punished for this."
"Run along, ya little scamp."
"Bart! Why are you doing that?"
"Well, this time you must be punished."
"No tricks, boy. I said I'm gonna punish you and come Hell or high water I... wait a minute..."
"Ice cream truck!"
"Me, me. I was here first!"
"Now, what were we talking about, boy?"
"Oh yeah. The trick is to say you're prejudiced against all races."
"I'unno."
"All right. All right. Bart, go to your room."
"How could you let this happen?"
"Oh. How convenient."
"Can't he be both like the late Earl Warren?"
"Now who's being naive."
"All right, Marge. I swear to you, the next time he does something wrong I'll punish him and make it stick."
"Sorry, but the punishment stands."
"Bart, didn't I ask you to watch Maggie?"
"All right, boy. This calls for the biggest punishment I've ever handed down. And this time it's gonna stick!"
"Damn right. Bart, you can't go to see that Itchy & Scratchy movie. Ever!"
"Don't point that thing at me. I said you're not going to the movie and I'm sticking to it."
"Hmm..."
"YUMMY, YUMMY, YUMMY/ I'VE GOT LOVE IN MY TUMMY/ AND I FEEL LIKE LOVIN' YOU..."
"... LOVE YOU, SUCH A SWEET THING/ GOOD ENOUGH TO EAT THING..."
"Someday you'll thank me for this, son."
"No, it's true. You know, when I was a boy I really wanted a catcher's mitt. But, my dad wouldn't get it for me. So I held my breath until I passed out and banged my head on the coffee table. The doctor thought I might have brain damage."
"I like stories."
"I know my punishment might seem a little harsh, but I can't go back on it. You're welcome to watch anything you want on TV."
"I know you're upset right now, so I'll pretend you didn't say that."
"But then I won't be watching TV. You can see the bind I'm in."
"Don't you think I know that?"
"Ah, sweet soft-hearted Marge. You just can't see the big picture. If I stick to my guns, the boy could wind up Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. If I fail, the best he could do is judge at a ""Mister Tight Buns"" competition. I can't let that happen, I won't let that happen and I can't let that happen."
"No, son, we both won. You don't know it now, but I've started you on the road to somewhere very special."
"All right. I think you've learned your lesson."
"I'll get it son."
"Mmm... Soylent Green."
"Which one's the mouse?"
"Itchy's a jerk."
"Oooh, give it here."
"Yeah, but what're ya gonna do?"
"I wish I could retire."
"Boy, that'd be sweet."
"Can't talk -- busy."
"All part of God's great plan."
"The half-assed approach to foundation repair."
"Ready!"
"Hand me my patching trowel, boy."
"Hmm."
"No."
"Wha-do I do..."
"Wait a minute..."
"Wait a minute..."
"Uh huh?"
"Did you see the bubble?"
"Forget it. You're not the only foundation guy in town!"
"Let's see, foundation repair... Ah, here we are..."
"Huh?"
"Marge, it'll cost eighty-five hundred dollars. We only have five hundred in the bank. That leaves... eighty- hundred we need."
"Hey! Then I could follow my dream. Living in the woods and keeping a journal of my thoughts."
"March 15... I wish I'd brought a TV. Oh God, how I miss TV."
"Bo-ring!"
"Bo-ring."
"Forget it Marge. We already live together; we shouldn't work together. As the Bible says ""Thou shalt not horn in on thy husband's... racket."""
"It's in there. Look, Marge we just don't need the money that bad."
"Marge have you seen my lunch box?"
"Marge, you're making a big mistake. I'm going to see you all day at work and all night at home..."
"And that's good! But, here's the bad part... uh... uh... Ooh, look at that headline: ""Canada To Hold Referendum."" Sorry Marge, can't talk now."
"Yeah, lemonade is good."
"Wha dey do?"
"Now, Marge, just remember, if something goes wrong at the plant, blame the guy who can't speak English. Ah, Tibor, how many times have you saved my butt ."
"Marge what're you doing? It's lunch time."
"Marge, Marge, Marge, let's file this under ""R"" for arrivederci."
"Don't worry, baby. That tube'll know what to do."
"Marge, get my gun."
"You can't take our donuts!"
"Oh, man, I really gotta..."
"I'm used to seeing people promoted ahead of me... friends... co-workers... Tibor... I never thought it'd be my own wife."
"Are you kidding? I work like a Japanese Beaver."
"Well, I won't sleep in the same bed with a woman who thinks I'm lazy. I'm gonna go right down stairs, unfold the couch, unroll a sleeping bag... Eh, goodnight."
"I've got a better idea -- get the hell out!"
"He left his briefcase. Hey! It's full of shredded newspapers."
"No! Mr. Burns, I'm not leaving until you say you're sorry for what you did to my wife."
"Damn right!"
"Gotcha. Marge, we're gettin' some drive-thru then we're doin' it twice."
"Ooh, me too."
"Ahhh, bacon."
"Gonna run out the clock in Florida, eh?"
"Mmm... no."
"Mmm... no."
"Wha... hey, moose! Shoo! Go! Talkin' to you! Get off my lawn! Now!"
"Hello, what's this? Wire hangers! Expired medicine! Old newspapers! Okay Homer, stay calm. Just quietly get this stuff inside your house."
"Homer, you're not listening!"
"Come on, Marge. Maybe I'm not getting enough ...estrogen."
"Aye, aye Captain! Marge, we're going to that restaurant."
"Mmmm, shrimp."
"There you are! Thought you could get away, huh?"
"My hammock! Do you understand? Mine! Don't look that way."
"...All you can eat, ha!"
"Shut up, you little monsters! Hello, I was wondering if you'd like to baby-sit my little angels."
"No ""All You Can Eat Seafood."" I wore my extra-loose pants for nothing. Nothing!"
"Great. Oh, uh... and there was something else. Something I was supposed to tiptoe around..."
"That's it! Whew, I'm glad one of us remembered. That could have been embarrassing."
"Heh heh, I know what you mean. Just let me make sure we're not talking about food."
"Right. Me neither. We're talkin' about sex, right?"
"I hear you loud and clear."
"All you can eat. All you can eat."
"Can't talk... eating."
"Hey, hey, hey!"
"But the sign said ""All you can eat."""
"I'm gonna fight this thing."
"Sorry Marge, this is my quest. I'm like that guy -- that Spanish guy -- you know, he fought the windmills..."
"No, that's not it. What's his name? The Man of La Mancha."
"No!"
"Fine. I'll look it up."
"Never mind."
"All right. Hit the change of venue button. Now!"
"So you think I have a case?"
"Woo hoo!"
"Uhh... can't you see I'm reading the uh..."
"..._______ calendar? Hmm... Ooh, Mostly Mozart is in town."
"But Marge, I think he should learn about it the same way I did."
"Maybe you're right. Now, if you'll excuse us, this is a sacred moment between a boy and his father."
"Son, a woman is a lot like, uh... ... a refrigerator. They're about six feet tall, 300 pounds... they make ice and ... Oh, wait a minute, actually, a woman is more like a beer! They smell good -- they look good -- you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You want to drink another woman!"
"So I says, ""Yeah, if you want that money, come and find it 'cause I don't know where it is you baloney..."" You make me wanna retch..."
"I married her!"
"Thanks, that means a lot to me."
"Hey!"
"Right here."
"Come on, Marge, let the people see your pretty face."
"How someone someone abuse their body that way?"
"Moe! Don't throw out that brine!"
"But Marge, Alan Thicke is throwing knives at Ricardo Montalban."
"Ohh."
"Well, I got him as good as he got me."
"It's a pornography store. I was buying pornography."
"What country is this car from?"
"Kids! If we buy a new car, we get our parking validated for free."
"Do you come with the car?"
"Bart! That car belonged to Bonnie and Clyde! Show a little respect."
"The Batmobile!"
"Adam West! Hey kids, Batman!"
"Nice meetin' ya! Just keep moving. Don't make eye contact."
"Wow! Just think what I could do with that plow."
"Mr. President, those young people are about to get a dose of reality."
"Eh, I can't afford it."
"Well... I really should discuss this with my wife."
"What? You think I'm going to buy a twenty thousand dollar truck just because you make that noise?"
"I'll take it!"
"If you're gonna get mad at me every time I do something stupid, then I guess I'll just have to stop doing stupid things."
"Fine. I'll never ever do another stupid thing. Good night!"
"No."
"Marge didn't reckon with these fliers and this flashy jacket."
"Dear Lord, in your infinite wisdom, you know the number to call when you need a plow is KLONDIKE 5-3226."
"Not as low as my low, low prices."
"Uh, huh, that's Mr. Plow."
"I'm gonna lose my plow."
"Hmmm."
"Almost time for our commercial."
"Alcoholics, the unemployable, angry loners..."
"It may be on a lousy channel but the Simpsons are on TV!"
"Stop!"
"Get out of here, you lousy... season!"
"Hello, I'm Mr. Plow. Are you tired of having your hands cut off by snow blowers, and the inevitable heart attacks that come with shoveling snow?"
"Then call KLONDIKE 5-3226. Call now and receive a free T-shirt."
"He could still surprise ya!"
"Absolutely! My prices are so low, you'll think I've suffered brain damage."
"Shut up, boy."
"So remember..."
"CALL MISTER PLOW, THAT'S MY NAME! THAT NAME AGAIN IS MISTER PLOW!"
"Well, John Q Driveway has our number. Now we play the waiting game."
"The waiting game sucks. Let's play ""Hungry, Hungry Hippos."""
"Well wishing won't make it so. You've got to pull up your diaper, get out there, and be the best damn Barney you can be."
"How do you think he'll do, Moe?"
"Cutting my nails? Brushing my teeth?"
"Oooh. Heh heh heh."
"CALL MR. PLOW / THAT'S MY NAME / THAT NAME AGAIN IS MR. PLOW."
"Ah, white gold."
"What the... What happ... uh... oh no..."
"Barney, you stole my idea!"
"How could you, Barney? After all I've done for you."
"Flanders, I thought I was your plow man."
"Forget it pal. I don't need your phoney baloney job. I'll take your money but I'm not gonna plow your driveway."
"Mr. West! You said there was a job for me!"
"Ring, damn you. Ring!"
"Mister Plow... that name again is Mr. Plow."
"Oh, you want the Mister Plow who plows driveways. This is Tony Plow. You know... from ""Leave It To Beaver""? Yeah, they were gay."
"Oh, what am I gonna do?"
"I know! I'll do a rap. I'M MR. PLOW AND I'M HERE TO SAY: I'M THE PLOWINGEST GUY IN THE USA / I GOT A BIG PLOW AND I MOVE A LOT OF THINGS / LIKE YOUR COW IT YOU HAVE ONE."
"All right."
"I don't know."
"I thought there was chocolate inside."
"Well, why was it wrapped in foil?"
"Hmm..."
"Hello... Plow King? I was wondering if you could plow my driveway on top of forbidding Widow's Peak."
"There's a $10,000 bill in it for you."
"Uh... all of them. They're having a party. Jimmy Carter's passed out on the couch."
"Well, I guess he just doesn't respect his customers."
"Kiss my asphalt."
"So I says, ""Kiss my asphalt."" Hmm? Hmm?"
"This is all my fault. I've gotta save him."
"Hey, this old girl's as sure-footed as a mountain goat."
"Easy... easy..."
"Barney!"
"Barney, that's great. When two best friends work together, not even God, Himself, can stop them."
"Y'ello."
"Oh yeah? How dumb do you think I --"
"You mean..."
"MR. PLOW, THAT'S MY NAME. THAT NAME AGAIN IS MR. PLOW. Our forecast calls for flurries of passion followed by extended periods of gettin' it on."
"Maggie, can you say ""daddy""? Dad-dy?"
"Did you hear that? She said ""burlap."""
"Takes one to know one!"
"Yeah, tell it, Mom."
"WHEN THE WORKING DAY IS DONE / GIRLS JUST WANNA HAVE FU-UN / THAT'S ALL WE REALLY WANNNNT..."
"Homer is what grown ups call me. Call me Daddy."
"Daddy."
"Daddy."
"Ye-esss..."
"Why you little..."
"He'll tire himself out soon."
"Heh, heh. Got your nose."
"Nooo! Bart, don't you ever do that again. Understand?"
"We're gonna start doin' it in the morning?"
"Oh."
"Marge that's..."
"No, we won't. I've got it all figured out. The baby can have Bart's crib and Bart can sleep with us until he's 21!"
"My cousin Frank did it."
"He became Francine back in '76. Then he joined that cult. I think his name is Mother Shabubu, now."
"Mmmm. Hog fat."
"Once we get these cats out of the way it won't be too bad."
"Wow. How much? How much?"
"I can't afford that!"
"Dad, I have a problem."
"Are you done?"
"Dad, I don't need advice, I need $15,000 to buy a home."
"You didn't build this house. You won"
"it on a crooked '50's game show!"
"Dad, first you gave me life, now you've given me a home for my family. I'd be honored if you came to live with us."
"About three weeks."
"Maggie I'll give you this cookie if you talk."
"What? What?"
"All right, you win round seven."
"Your what-what?"
"Eh, you don't want to hear that story. I know! I'll tell you about the time I got locked in the bank vault with Mr. Mooney. It was another one of my hair-brained schemes."
"Wait a minute. That was a ""Lucy"" show... Okay, where were we?"
"Ah yes. I remember the day we moved in..."
"Bart, I told you not to use that word. Call me ""Daddy."""
"Hi, Flanders."
