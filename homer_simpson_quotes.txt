I'm not a bad guy! I work hard, and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to Hell?
It’s not the winning that matters, it’s the donuts.
To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems.
Awww, what the hell, I’m not a hero. I’m a donut-eating man.
If something’s hard to do, then it’s not worth doing.
A person who’s really good at not thinking is a genius in disguise.
Life is a mystery, and I’m the mystery’s biggest fan.

I’m not a people person.
Don’t make me think about things. You know I’m not good at it.
I’m not a failure. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.
I’m not a nerd. I’m just smarter than you.
Marge, you can’t keep a marriage together with only love and sex. You need humor and donuts.
I don’t know what I’m doing, but I’m pretty sure I’m doing it wrong.
If at first you don’t succeed, blame someone else.
I’m not a nerd. I’m just smarter than you.
You know what they say: 'The better you are at something, the worse you are at other things.'
I don’t care what anyone says, I think I’m doing great.
You know, if you ever feel down, just remember that the world is a huge place, and you’re probably doing better than most people.
D'oh!

I’ve got 99 problems, but none of them are my fault.
I’m no expert, but I’m sure everything will turn out just fine.
You know, if you want something done right, you have to bribe someone.
They say you should never give up, but I’m pretty sure giving up is an option.

I’m not a great dad, but at least I’m better than Flanders.
You don’t need to be smart to be successful, just lucky.

The secret to happiness is getting what you want. The second secret is pretending you don’t care when you don’t get it.

How could I be so stupid and so brilliant at the same time?
Oh, I’m not drunk. I’m just exhausted.
I don’t need therapy. I’m just fine. Fine-ish.

I could be a genius if I applied myself, but it’s so much more fun not to.

You don’t need to be smart to be successful, just lucky.
I’m not a people person.
I'm not a bad guy! I work hard, and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to Hell?
I have a lot of thinking to do, but I’m going to do it tomorrow.
You can't keep blaming yourself. Just blame yourself once, and move on.
If something’s hard to do, then it’s not worth doing.

The world is a cruel, heartless place. But that doesn’t mean you can’t still have fun.

I never apologize. I’m sorry, but that’s just the way I am.
I’m not a people person.
A person who’s really good at not thinking is a genius in disguise.
Oh, I’m not drunk. I’m just exhausted.

My idea of a good time is sitting in front of the TV with a big bowl of potato chips.
The world is a cruel, heartless place. But that doesn’t mean you can’t still have fun.
Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.
I can’t make decisions like that. It’s too complicated. I’ll just leave it to Marge.
I’m not lazy, I’m on energy-saving mode.
I’m not afraid of failure. I just prefer to avoid it.
I’m not a bad person! I’m just a little morally challenged.
In my day, we had a saying: 'If you want something done right, do it yourself.' But now, we have a new saying: 'If you want something done right, get someone else to do it.'
I’m not a great dad, but at least I’m better than Flanders.
If you want something done right, don’t ask me to do it.
I’m really not the right person for this job, but I’ll do it anyway.
Just do what I do. Keep calm, pretend to be normal, and blame Flanders.
A person who’s really good at not thinking is a genius in disguise.
I’ve learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead.
If life gives you lemons, throw them back.

I'm not a bad guy! I work hard, and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to Hell?
I never had any expectations, so I’m never disappointed.
I don’t know what I’m doing, but I’m pretty sure I’m doing it wrong.
I’m not a failure. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.

You know what they say: 'The better you are at something, the worse you are at other things.'
If something’s hard to do, then it’s not worth doing.
I’m not just doing this for me. I’m doing this for my country.
Mmm... bacon.
You can't keep blaming yourself. Just blame yourself once, and move on.
I’m not a bad person! I’m just a little morally challenged.
I’m not afraid of dying. I’m just afraid of what comes after. And I’m not ready for that.
You can’t win them all, but you can try.
Marge, I have a lot of doubts, but when I think about it, I believe in myself.
I’m going to sit here, do nothing, and pretend to be busy.
I could be a genius if I applied myself, but it’s so much more fun not to.
It’s a good thing I’m dumb. If I were smart, I’d be much more miserable.
In my day, we had a saying: 'If you want something done right, do it yourself.' But now, we have a new saying: 'If you want something done right, get someone else to do it.'
I can’t promise you that I’ll always be the best dad, but I’ll always try my best.

The secret to happiness is getting what you want. The second secret is pretending you don’t care when you don’t get it.
If life gives you lemons, throw them back.
Marge, you can’t keep a marriage together with only love and sex. You need humor and donuts.
Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.
D'oh!
Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.
How could I be so stupid and so brilliant at the same time?
D'oh!
A person who’s really good at not thinking is a genius in disguise.
They say you should never give up, but I’m pretty sure giving up is an option.

Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.
If I’m not back in five minutes... wait longer.
I’m not afraid of failure. I just prefer to avoid it.
I’m not an alcoholic. I’m just a guy who loves beer.
What’s the point of going out? We’re just going to end up back here anyway.
You don’t need to be smart to know that I’m smart.
Awww, what the hell, I’m not a hero. I’m a donut-eating man.
In my day, we had a saying: 'If you want something done right, do it yourself.' But now, we have a new saying: 'If you want something done right, get someone else to do it.'

You know, if you ever feel down, just remember that the world is a huge place, and you’re probably doing better than most people.
I never had any expectations, so I’m never disappointed.
You can’t argue with the truth. But that doesn’t stop me from trying.
The only thing I’m good at is finding new ways to mess up.

You can’t argue with the truth. But that doesn’t stop me from trying.
Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.
I’m not lazy, I’m on energy-saving mode.
I have no idea what’s going on, but it sounds fun.
The world is a cruel, heartless place. But that doesn’t mean you can’t still have fun.
A guy who’s lazy but still has great ideas is a genius.
I’m not lazy, I’m on energy-saving mode.
Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.
D'oh!
I have a lot of thinking to do, but I’m going to do it tomorrow.
I’m not an alcoholic. I’m just a guy who loves beer.
How could I be so stupid and so brilliant at the same time?
I’m not afraid of failure. I just prefer to avoid it.
I don’t care what anyone says, I think I’m doing great.
I’m not a people person.
The only reason I’d keep working at the nuclear plant is because of the donuts.
You can’t win them all, but you can try.
I’m not a nerd. I’m just smarter than you.
In my day, we had a saying: 'If you want something done right, do it yourself.' But now, we have a new saying: 'If you want something done right, get someone else to do it.'
D'oh!
You know, if you ever feel down, just remember that the world is a huge place, and you’re probably doing better than most people.
Mmm... bacon.
A person who’s really good at not thinking is a genius in disguise.

D'oh!
If you want something done right, don’t ask me to do it.
If something’s hard to do, then it’s not worth doing.
You can’t win them all, but you can try.
I’m going to sit here, do nothing, and pretend to be busy.
I’m not a bad person! I’m just a little morally challenged.
Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.
I'm not a bad guy! I work hard, and I love my kids. So why should I spend half my Sunday hearing about how I'm going to Hell?
Just do what I do. Keep calm, pretend to be normal, and blame Flanders.
I have a lot of thinking to do, but I’m going to do it tomorrow.

I can’t promise you that I’ll always be the best dad, but I’ll always try my best.

Marge, I have a lot of doubts, but when I think about it, I believe in myself.

You don’t need to be smart to know that I’m smart.

I’m no expert, but I’m sure everything will turn out just fine.

The secret to happiness is getting what you want. The second secret is pretending you don’t care when you don’t get it.
You don’t need to be smart to know that I’m smart.
I’ve got 99 problems, but none of them are my fault.

I never had any expectations, so I’m never disappointed.

What’s the point of going out? We’re just going to end up back here anyway.
You know, if you ever feel down, just remember that the world is a huge place, and you’re probably doing better than most people.
I’m not a great dad, but at least I’m better than Flanders.
Mmm... donuts.
Just do what I do. Keep calm, pretend to be normal, and blame Flanders.
It’s a good thing I’m dumb. If I were smart, I’d be much more miserable.

I have a lot of thinking to do, but I’m going to do it tomorrow.
You know, if you want something done right, you have to bribe someone.
I don’t need to be smarter. I need to be luckier.
I’m going to sit here, do nothing, and pretend to be busy.
I’m not afraid of failure. I just prefer to avoid it.
I’ve learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead.
I’m going to sit here, do nothing, and pretend to be busy.
I don’t need therapy. I’m just fine. Fine-ish.
Oh, I’m not drunk. I’m just exhausted.
You can't keep blaming yourself. Just blame yourself once, and move on.

Just do what I do. Keep calm, pretend to be normal, and blame Flanders.
If you want something done right, don’t ask me to do it.
I’m not an alcoholic. I’m just a guy who loves beer.

It’s a good thing I’m dumb. If I were smart, I’d be much more miserable.
I’m not lazy, I’m on energy-saving mode.
You know, if you ever feel down, just remember that the world is a huge place, and you’re probably doing better than most people.

I’m not a great dad, but at least I’m better than Flanders.
I don’t know what I’m doing, but I’m pretty sure I’m doing it wrong.
I can’t make decisions like that. It’s too complicated. I’ll just leave it to Marge.

The only reason I’d keep working at the nuclear plant is because of the donuts.
I’m not an alcoholic. I’m just a guy who loves beer.

You know, if you want something done right, you have to bribe someone.
I could be a genius if I applied myself, but it’s so much more fun not to.
My idea of a good time is sitting in front of the TV with a big bowl of potato chips.
Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.
I’m not a nerd. I’m just smarter than you.
I can’t make decisions like that. It’s too complicated. I’ll just leave it to Marge.
You can't keep blaming yourself. Just blame yourself once, and move on.
Mmm... bacon.
Awww, what the hell, I’m not a hero. I’m a donut-eating man.
I have a lot of thinking to do, but I’m going to do it tomorrow.
I’m not afraid of dying. I’m just afraid of what comes after. And I’m not ready for that.
Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.
If you want something done right, don’t ask me to do it.

I’ve got 99 problems, but none of them are my fault.
I have a lot of thinking to do, but I’m going to do it tomorrow.
If I’m not back in five minutes... wait longer.
I’m no expert, but I’m sure everything will turn out just fine.

I’m not lazy, I’m on energy-saving mode.

A guy who’s lazy but still has great ideas is a genius.
I’m not an alcoholic. I’m just a guy who loves beer.
I can’t promise you that I’ll always be the best dad, but I’ll always try my best.
What’s the point of going out? We’re just going to end up back here anyway.

You can’t argue with the truth. But that doesn’t stop me from trying.
You don’t need to be smart to be successful, just lucky.

Life is a mystery, and I’m the mystery’s biggest fan.
I’m really not the right person for this job, but I’ll do it anyway.
The only thing I’m good at is finding new ways to mess up.
I could be a genius if I applied myself, but it’s so much more fun not to.
It’s not the winning that matters, it’s the donuts.
If at first you don’t succeed, blame someone else.
I’m not afraid of failure. I just prefer to avoid it.
It’s a good thing I’m dumb. If I were smart, I’d be much more miserable.

This is my ‘thinking’ face.
I’m not a people person.
I’ve learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead.
I never had any expectations, so I’m never disappointed.
Marge, you can’t keep a marriage together with only love and sex. You need humor and donuts.

If something’s hard to do, then it’s not worth doing.
Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.
Awww, what the hell, I’m not a hero. I’m a donut-eating man.
Mmm... bacon.
I’m not lazy, I’m on energy-saving mode.
You know, if you ever feel down, just remember that the world is a huge place, and you’re probably doing better than most people.
I don’t know what I’m doing, but I’m pretty sure I’m doing it wrong.

I’m no expert, but I’m sure everything will turn out just fine.
I’m not lazy, I’m on energy-saving mode.
You know what they say: 'The better you are at something, the worse you are at other things.'
You know, if you ever feel down, just remember that the world is a huge place, and you’re probably doing better than most people.
This is my ‘thinking’ face.
A person who’s really good at not thinking is a genius in disguise.
I have no idea what’s going on, but it sounds fun.
If I’m not back in five minutes... wait longer.
You don’t need to be smart to be successful, just lucky.
If life gives you lemons, throw them back.
Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.
I’m not a people person.
I’m not an alcoholic. I’m just a guy who loves beer.
I can’t make decisions like that. It’s too complicated. I’ll just leave it to Marge.
In my day, we had a saying: 'If you want something done right, do it yourself.' But now, we have a new saying: 'If you want something done right, get someone else to do it.'
Mmm... donuts.
I don’t know what I’m doing, but I’m pretty sure I’m doing it wrong.
I have a lot of thinking to do, but I’m going to do it tomorrow.
In my day, we had a saying: 'If you want something done right, do it yourself.' But now, we have a new saying: 'If you want something done right, get someone else to do it.'
I never had any expectations, so I’m never disappointed.
You can't keep blaming yourself. Just blame yourself once, and move on.
If at first you don’t succeed, blame someone else.
A person who’s really good at not thinking is a genius in disguise.
The world is a cruel, heartless place. But that doesn’t mean you can’t still have fun.
I never apologize. I’m sorry, but that’s just the way I am.
You don’t need to be smart to be successful, just lucky.
To alcohol! The cause of, and solution to, all of life's problems.
You can’t argue with the truth. But that doesn’t stop me from trying.
Awww, what the hell, I’m not a hero. I’m a donut-eating man.
What’s the point of going out? We’re just going to end up back here anyway.
I’m really not the right person for this job, but I’ll do it anyway.
They say you should never give up, but I’m pretty sure giving up is an option.
Marge, it takes two to lie. One to lie and one to listen.
I’m not afraid of failure. I just prefer to avoid it.
I’m not a great dad, but at least I’m better than Flanders.

I’ve learned that life is one crushing defeat after another until you just wish Flanders was dead.
The only thing I’m good at is finding new ways to mess up.
I don’t know what I’m doing, but I’m pretty sure I’m doing it wrong.
I’m not a failure. I’ve just found 10,000 ways that won’t work.
I’m going to sit here, do nothing, and pretend to be busy.
Awww, what the hell, I’m not a hero. I’m a donut-eating man.
The only reason I’d keep working at the nuclear plant is because of the donuts.
You know, if you want something done right, you have to bribe someone.
